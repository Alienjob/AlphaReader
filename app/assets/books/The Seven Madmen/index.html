    <div class="paragraph">Remo Erdosain's Buenos Aires is a dim, seething, paranoid hive of hustlers and whores, scoundrels and madmen, and Erdosain feels his soul is as polluted as anything in this dingy city. Possessed by the directionlessness of the society around him, trapped between spiritual anguish and madness, he clings to anything that can give his life meaning: small-time defrauding of his employers, hatred of his wife's cousin Gregorio Barsut, a part in the Astrologer's plans for a new world order… but is that enough? Or is the only appropriate response to reality &mdash; insanity?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Written in 1929, The Seven Madmen depicts an Argentina on the edge of the precipice. This teeming world of dreamers, revolutionaries and scheming generals was Arlt's uncanny prophesy of the cycle of conflict which would scar his country's passage through the twentieth century, and even today it retains its power as one of the great apocalyptic works of modern literature.</div>

    ABOUT THE AUTHORS <br class="calibre9" />
   </h1>
   <div class="paragraph">ROBERTO ARLT was born in Buenos Aires in 1900. He had a deeply unhappy childhood and was brought up in the city’s crowded tenement houses &mdash; the same tenements which feature in <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>. As a journalist, Arlt described the rich and vivid life of Buenos Aires. As an inventor, he patented a method to prevent ladders in women’s stockings.</div>
   <div class="paragraph">Roberto Arlt died suddenly of a heart attack in Buenos Aires in 1942. He was the author of the novels <em class="calibre11">The Enraged Toy, The Flamethrowers, Love the Enchanter</em> and several plays. First published in 1929, <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em> perfectly captures the conflict of Argentine society at a crucial moment in its history.</div>
   <br class="calibre1" />
   <div class="paragraph">Nick Caistor is the translator of <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>. His “Arlt’s Life and Times” is included as the first of two Afterwords.</div>
   <div class="paragraph">Roberto Bolaño’s “The Vagaries of the Literature of Doom” is the second Afterword.</div>
   <br class="calibre1" />
   <div class="paragraph"><strong class="calibre12">Praise for <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em></strong></div>
   <div class="paragraph">“If great means anything at all, then Arlt is surely a great writer … he is Latin America’s first truly urban novelist … this is the power which inspired literature possesses” <em class="calibre11">Guardian</em></div>
   <div class="paragraph">“The reader is possessed almost demonically by these characters … an indestructible force of great literature” Julio Cortázar</div>
   <div class="paragraph">“Let’s say, modestly, that Arlt is Jesus Christ. Argentina, of course, is Israel and Buenos Aires is Jerusalem … Arlt is quick, a risk taker, adaptable, a born survivor … Arlt is a Russian, a character from Dostoyevsky, while Borges is an Englishman, a character from Chesterton or Shaw or Stevenson … without doubt an important part of Argentinian and Latin American literature” Roberto Bolaño</div>
   <div class="paragraph">“Arlt is, plain and simple, the father of the modern Argentinian novel … he is the most important Argentinian novelist, the greatest” Ricardo Piglia</div>
   <div class="paragraph">“If ever anyone from these shores could be called a literary genius, his name was Roberto Arlt … I am talking about a novelist who will be famous in time … and who, unbelievably, is almost unknown in the world today” Juan Carlos Onetti</div>

     THE SURPRISE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">As soon as he opened the frosted glass door to the manager’s office, Remo Erdosain wanted to turn back; he realised he was a lost man, but it was too late.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Waiting for him were the director, a short squat man with the head of a wild boar, grey hair cropped short in the style of Umberto I of Italy, and an implacable gaze that filtered through grey fish eyes; Gualdi, small, skinny, sweet-tongued, but with a calculating stare; and the assistant manager, son of the man with the boar’s head, a handsome young fellow of thirty, with a shock of white hair and a cynical aspect, his voice gruff and his look as harsh as his father’s. None of the three: the director bending over some accounts, his assistant lolling back in an armchair with one leg dangling over the arm, or Gualdi hovering respectfully next to the desk, bothered to return Erdosain’s greeting. Only the assistant manager lifted his head and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’ve been told you’re a swindler, who has robbed us of 600 pesos.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And seven cents,” Gualdi added, as he passed a blotter over the director’s signature on one of the accounts. It was only then that the latter, as if making a great effort with his huge bull’s neck, raised his eyes. With his thumbs thrust through his waistcoat buttonholes, the director exuded an air of wisdom, but his eyes narrowed as he pored without apparent ill-feeling over Erdosain’s scrawny, expressionless features.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why are you so badly dressed?” he wanted to know.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I earn nothing as a collector.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the money you stole from us?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I haven’t stolen anything. It’s all lies.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’re in a position to account for everything, are you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If you wish, by midday today.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This answer won him a brief respite. The three men exchanged inquiring glances, then finally the assistant manager shrugged his shoulders and said, with his father’s approval:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … you have until tomorrow at three. Bring all your tally books and your receipts … You can go now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The decision took Erdosain so completely by surprise that he remained standing there abjectly, staring at the three of them. Yes, all three of them. At Gualdi, who had humiliated him despite calling himself a socialist; at the assistant manager, who had scornfully stared at his ragged tie; at the director whose bristling boar’s head was now tilted in his direction, his cynical, obscene gaze screened by the grey slit of his narrowed eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Yet Erdosain did not budge … He wanted to say something to them, without knowing what, something that would make them see the crushing misfortune that made his life a misery; so he just stood there, forlorn, the black cube of the safe on a level with his eyes, feeling his back bending further and further with the passing minutes while he nervously twisted the brim of his black hat, and his own look became more and more furtive and sad. Finally, he blurted out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, can I leave?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I mean can I draw my wages today and …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … hand your receipts over to Suarez and bring everything else here tomorrow at three, without fail.” “Yes … everything.” Turning on his heel, Erdosain left without another word.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He walked down Chile to the Paseo Colon. He felt himself hemmed in by invisible pressures. The sun picked out the disgusting interiors as the street sloped downwards. Such a jumble of disparate thoughts raced through his mind, it would have taken him hours of hard work to unravel them. Later he recalled that not for one moment had it occurred to him to wonder who might have betrayed him.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-48" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-5" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897202234544" class="calibre10"></a>
     STATES OF MIND <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">He knew he was a thief. But the category he was labelled with did not interest him. Besides, the word “thief” had little resonance with what he felt inside. There, he was aware of a different feeling, of a kind of circular silence that pierced the mass of his skull like a steel rod, leaving him deaf to anything but his own wretched despair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This circle of silence and darkness shattered the continuity of Erdosain’s ideas. As his reasoning faltered, he found it impossible to trace the link between the place he called home and an institution that bore the name of prison.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was thinking telegraphically, omitting prepositions, and this jangled his nerves still further. He lived endless empty hours when he could have committed any crime without feeling in the least responsible. Logically, no judge would have understood what was going on. But Erdosain was already a hollow man, a shell moved simply by the force of habit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">If he had gone on working in the Sugar Company, it had not been to steal even more money, but because he was hoping for some extraordinary event, something absolutely extraordinary, which would give his life an unexpected twist and save him from the catastrophe he could see knocking at his door.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The name Erdosain gave to this mood of dreams and disquiet that led him to roam like a sleepwalker through the days was “the anguish zone”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He imagined this zone floating above cities, about two metres in the air, and pictured it graphically like an area of salt flats or deserts that are shown on maps by tiny dots, as dense as herring roe.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This anguish zone was the product of mankind’s suffering. It slid from one place to the next like a cloud of poison gas, seeping through walls, passing straight through buildings, without ever losing its flat horizontal shape; a two-dimensional anguish that left an after-taste of tears in throats it sliced like a guillotine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This was the explanation Erdosain reached when he felt the first nauseas of despair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What am I doing with my life?” he would ask himself, trying with that question to shed light on the origins of this anxiety which led him to long for an existence where the next day would not be merely time measured out in a repetition of today, but something different and totally unexpected, like in the plots of North American films, where yesterday’s tramp suddenly becomes today’s secret society boss, and the gold-digging secretary turns out to be a multimillionairess in disguise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the miserable uncertainty that followed, this need for marvels that he could not possibly satisfy &mdash; since he was no more than a failed inventor and a criminal on the threshold of gaol &mdash; left the acid taste of frustration in Erdosain’s mouth, setting his teeth on edge as if he had been chewing lemons.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When in this mood, he dreamt up the wildest nonsense. He even imagined that the rich, tired of having to listen to the moans of the wretched, built huge cages pulled by teams of horses. Gaolers chosen for their strength hunted the poor with dogcatchers’ poles, and Erdosain could clearly see one scene where a tall, dishevelled woman was chasing after a cage where her one-eyed son was calling out to her, until finally a “dogcatcher”, weary of hearing her cries, beat her senseless with the handle of his pole.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As this apparition faded, Erdosain said, horrified at himself: “But what soul, what kind of soul do I have?” and since his mind was still being propelled by the impulse that had produced the nightmare, he added: “I should have been born a lackey, one of those vile, perfumed lackeys whom rich prostitutes use to do up their bodices, while their lover is lolling on the sofa smoking a cigarette.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His thoughts flew off once more, this time down into a kitchen in the basement of a luxury mansion. Around the table were gathered two maids, a chauffeur and a levantine trader selling garters and perfumes. On this occasion, Erdosain himself would be wearing a short black jacket not long enough to cover his backside, and a white tie. All of a sudden the “master” would call him, a man who was his mirror image, except that he did not shave his moustaches and wore glasses. Erdosain had no idea what his master wanted of him, but would never forget the strange look he gave him as he left the room. Then he went back to the kitchen to swap dirty stories with the chauffeur, who to the maids’ great amusement, and complete silence from the Arab pederast, was telling of how he had seduced the daughter of a high society lady, a girl of tender years.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain said again to himself: “Yes, I am a lackey. I have the soul of a true lackey,” and clenched his teeth in satisfaction as he insulted and degraded himself in this way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At other times he saw himself leaving a devout old spinster’s bedroom, unctuously carrying a heavy chamberpot. Suddenly he was accosted by a priest &mdash; a regular visitor to the house &mdash; who asked him, smiling beatifically: “And how are your religious duties going, Ernesto?” And he, Ernesto, Ambrosio or Jose, was living the sordid life of an obscene, hypocritical servant.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Whenever he thought like this, a spasm of madness ran right through him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain knew only too well he was gratuitously offending and fouling his soul. As he deliberately delved into the mire, he suffered the same terror as someone who dreams they are falling into an abyss but knows they will not die.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sometimes he felt compelled to humiliate himself, like saints do when they kiss the wounds of plague-bearers; not out of compassion, but so that they will be more worthy of God’s mercy, even though He is revolted at the way they are seeking heaven through such disgusting tests of faith.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But once these images had vanished and all that was left in his mind was the “desire to know the meaning of life”, he would say to himself: “No, I’m not a lackey … truly, I’m not …” and he wished only to go and beg his wife to take pity on him for all these horrible, sordid thoughts. But the memory that he had been forced to sacrifice himself so often for her filled him with a blind rage, and soon he found himself wanting to kill her.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He knew for certain that one day she would give herself to another man, and this was a further element he could count on to add to all his other anguish.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he stole the first twenty pesos, Erdosain was amazed at the ease with which “that” could be done &mdash; perhaps because before he did so, he thought he would have to overcome a whole host of scruples which given his circumstances he could not possibly accommodate. So he said to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s simply a question of having the will power and doing it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And there was no doubt “that” made life easier; thanks to “that” he had money, which made him feel strange, because it had cost him no effort to get it. And what disturbed Erdosain most was not the theft as such, but that his being a thief might show on his face. He was forced to rob because he earned such a pittance each month. Eighty, a hundred, or a hundred and twenty pesos, according to how much he collected, because his wage included a commission for every cent he brought in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Some days he carried around four or five thousand pesos, while he went hungry, and had to bear the stench of an imitation leather bag inside which lay happiness in the form of banknotes, cheques, money transfers, payment orders.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">For a long while, despite the misery gradually eating away at his house and home, the idea of stealing from the company had never occurred to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His wife reproached him for having to scrimp and save every day; he listened to her reproaches in silence, but when he was on his own would say to himself: “What would she have me do?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he had the idea, when the glimmer of an idea occurred to him that he could cheat on his bosses, he felt as delighted as if he had thought of a new invention. Stealing? Why hadn’t he thought of it before?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was dismayed at his own feebleness. He even criticised himself for lacking initiative &mdash; at that time (this was three months prior to the events narrated here) he was having to do without most things, even though large sums of money passed through his hands every day.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And what aided and abetted his fraudulent dealings was the Sugar Company’s negligence.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-49" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897202209584" class="calibre10"></a>
     TERROR IN THE STREET <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Without doubt Erdosain led a strange life, because sometimes a sudden hope propelled him into the street.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He would catch a bus and get off in Palermo or Belgrano. As he walked along the silent avenues lost in thought, he would say to himself: “A young woman will see me, a tall, pale, intense girl out driving her Rolls-Royce just for the sake of it. She will be driving round sadly. All at once she will spot me and understand I am the love of her life, and that look of hers &mdash; until that moment, an insult to the unfortunate &mdash; will settle on me &mdash; and her eyes will fill with tears.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This was how Erdosain’s foolish fantasy played itself out as he walked slowly along in the shade of the tall house fronts and the green plane trees, which cast their triangular shadows on to the pavement’s white mosaics.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She’ll be a millionairess, but I’ll say to her: ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t touch you. Even if you wanted to give yourself to me, I would not have you.’ She would look at me in astonishment, and I would tell her: ‘It’s no use, you see, it’s no use because I’m married.’ But she’ll offer Elsa a fortune to divorce me, and then we will wed, and sail off to Brazil on her yacht.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">That word “Brazil” gave his naive dream an exotic richness; rough and warm, it conjured up for him a pink and white coastline with cliffs and rocks plunging into a warm blue sea. Soon the young maid had lost her tragic air &mdash; beneath the white silk of a simple schoolgirl’s dress she was a happy, smiling creature, timorous yet daring.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Erdosain thought: “We’ll never have sexual contact. To make our love last, we’ll keep our desire in check; I won’t even kiss her on the mouth, only on the hand.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went on to imagine the happiness that would purify his life if something impossible like this were to happen: yet he knew it was easier to stop the earth turning than for such an unlikely event to take place. So he would say to himself with a sudden flash of resentful pride: “Well then, I’ll become a pimp.” At this thought, a terror far worse than any other unhinged his mind. He felt as though blood was pouring from every cranny of his soul &mdash; as if it was being torn into by a drill. With his powers of reasoning numbed, stunned with anguish, he set out on a wild search for a brothel. It was then he experienced the horror of empty nothingness, that luminous horror like the dazzling brilliance of the sun as it bounces off the curved surface of a salt-flat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He gave in to the kind of impulse that grips those who for the first time in their lives realise they may be at the prison gate, blind impulses that lead the wretched to stake everything on a card or a woman, searching perhaps for some sad, shocking confirmation of their existence, hoping to find in all that is vile and low some affirmation of purity that will save them for ever.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So beneath a yellow sun during the sweltering afternoon hours, Erdosain roamed the scorching pavements in search of the most disgusting brothels.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He preferred those whose porches were full of orange peel and trails of ashes, the ones with windows covered in red or green cloth and protected by wire netting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went in with death in his soul. Usually there was a single dull brown bench out in the patio with its square of blue sky up above. He would collapse exhausted on to it, enduring the madam’s icy stare until the girl, inevitably either excessively fat or skinny, came out to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then the whore would shout to him from the half-open door to the bedroom, from where the sounds of another man getting dressed could be heard: “Are you coming, sweetheart?” And Erdosain would go into the other room, his ears ringing and a mist swirling before his eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then he lay back on the bed varnished the colour of liver, on top of a bedcover soiled by one pair of boots after another.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden he felt like bursting into tears, and asking this ghastly slut what love was, that angelic love the celestial hosts sang of at the foot of the throne of the living God &mdash; but he could not bring himself to do so, because anguish gripped his throat while a wave of revulsion made his stomach clench like a fist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And while the prostitute’s hand paused in its movements among his clothes, Erdosain thought again to himself: “What have I done with my life?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A ray of sun slanted down through the cobweb-smeared transom, and the whore, on her side on the pillow with one leg crossed over his, slowly moved her hand while he gloomily reflected: “What have I done with my life?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly a feeling of remorse stiffened his soul; he was remembering how being penniless forced his sick wife to wash all her own clothes, and so in a rush of self-loathing he leapt from the bed, paid the prostitute, and fled without having touched her to the next hell to spend money that was not his, to sink ever deeper into the madness howling without respite around him.</div>

     A STRANGE MAN <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">At ten in the morning Erdosain was on the corner of Peru and Avenida de Mayo. He knew there was no way out of his dilemma but gaol, because he was sure Barsut would not lend him the money. All of a sudden he got a shock.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sitting at a café table was Ergueta, the pharmacist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His hat was pulled down over his ears; his thumbs stuck out across his huge belly, and a sour, bloated expression filled his sallow, nodding face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The glazed look in his bulging eyes, the flat hooked nose, pouched cheeks and drooping lower lip all went to create the impression of a congenital idiot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta’s enormous bulk was stuffed inside a cinnamon-coloured suit, and from time to time he lowered his face and rested his teeth on the marble pommel of his cane.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This eccentric gesture and the generally loathsome air his boredom conferred on him gave Ergueta the appearance of a white-slave trader. By chance, the pharmacist’s eyes met Erdosain’s as the latter walked over to him, and a childish smile lit up his face. He was still smiling as he shook hands, and Erdosain thought: “How many women have loved him for that smile!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Unable to stop himself, Erdosain blurted out the question:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, did you marry Hipólita …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but you can’t imagine the fuss it caused at home …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What? … Did they find out she was on the game?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … she told them that herself later on. Did you know that before she was a streetwalker, Hipólita worked as a housemaid?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Soon after our wedding, my mother, Hipólita, my sister and I went to visit a family. You can’t imagine what good memories they had! Even after ten years they recognised Hipólita as one of their maids. Unbelievable! She and I came back one way, my mother and Juana another. The whole story I’d invented to explain my marriage was ruined.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why did she confess she’d been a prostitute?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was in a moment’s anger. But she was right, wasn’t she? Hadn’t she made a new life for herself? Wasn’t she putting up with me &mdash; me, who had always brought them nothing but heartache?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Apart from that, how are things?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Fine … the pharmacy brings in sixty pesos a day. There’s no-one in Pico who knows the Bible the way I do. I challenged the priest to a debate, but he wasn’t having any of it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you still gambling?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and thanks to my great innocence, Jesus has revealed the secret of roulette to me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What d’you mean?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can’t imagine … the big secret … the law of static synchronicity … I’ve been to Montevideo twice and won a lot of money, but tonight I’m taking Hipólita, and we’ll break the bank.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden he launched into a complicated explanation:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Listen, say you place a certain sum on the first three balls, one in each line of twelve. If none of the three groups come up, then there’s an incredible imbalance. So you score one point to each twelve that didn’t come up. For the next three balls, your first twelve stays the same. Obviously zero doesn’t count and you play the groups in series of three balls. Then you add another point to the dozen that doesn’t have any crosses against it, you take off one or rather two points from the group that has come up three times, and on this basis you can calculate the greater or lesser probability, so you bet all you’ve got on the dozen or dozens that are left.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had not understood a word. As his hopes grew, he stifled his desire to laugh &mdash; there was no doubt about it, Ergueta was completely mad. So he replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Jesus only reveals such secrets to pious souls.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And also to holy fools,” Ergueta retorted, fixing him with a mocking smile while he winked his left eye: “Ever since I’ve been caught up in these mysteries I’ve made huge mistakes &mdash; like marrying that slut, for example …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But aren’t you happy with her?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“… believing in people’s goodness when everybody is simply trying to do you down and spread the word that you’re mad …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain frowned impatiently and said: “How can you expect them not to? You yourself have said you were a great sinner. Then suddenly you become religious, you marry a prostitute because that’s what the Bible says, you talk to people about the Fourth Seal and the Pale Horsemen … of course people will think you’re crazy, because they haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about. Don’t they reckon I’m mad because I say there should be hair salons for dogs, and that it would be a good idea to make metal shirtcuffs? But I don’t think you’re crazy. I really don’t. What you have is an over-abundance of life, of charity and of love for your neighbour. But I must say that the idea of Jesus revealing the secret of roulette to you does seem a bit far-fetched to me …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I won 5,000 pesos both times …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That may be so. But what saves you is not the secret of roulette but the fact that you have a noble soul. You’re capable of doing good, of taking pity on a man who’s at the gates of prison …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re right there,” Ergueta cut in. “In our town there’s another pharmacist, an old skinflint. His son stole 5,000 pesos from him … and then came to me to ask my advice. Do you know what I said? I told him to threaten his father with gaol for dealing cocaine if he reported the theft.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You see how I understand you? You wanted to save that old man’s soul by making the son commit a sin, one he would repent of for the rest of his life. Isn’t that right?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, in the Bible it is written: ‘and the father shall rise up against the son, and the son against the father …’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“See? I understand you. I don’t know what your destiny will be … man’s destiny is always uncertain. But I think you have a magnificent path before you. A strange path …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll be king of this world. Can you see it? I’ll win all the money I could wish for at every roulette table. I’ll go to Palestine, to Jerusalem and rebuild the great temple of Solomon …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you’ll rescue many people from despair. How many of them have been forced to steal from their bosses, have taken money entrusted to them! Can you imagine their anguish? An anguished person has no idea what he is doing … one day he steals a peso, the next it’s five, the day after, twenty … and by the time he realises it, he owes hundreds of pesos. So then he thinks … it’s not much, and suddenly he finds that 500 &mdash; no, 600 pesos and seven cents have vanished. Can you imagine it? Those are the people you must save … the anguished, the swindlers.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist thought it over for a moment. A serious look flitted across his bloated face; then he said: “You’re right … the world is full of riff-raff, of unhappy wretches … but what’s to be done about it? That’s what worries me. How can we present the sacred truths anew to these faithless people?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But what people need is money, not sacred truths.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, that’s what you get for neglecting the holy scriptures. A man who carries the sacred truths inside him will not steal from his boss, will not swindle the firm he works for, will not find himself having to go to gaol from one day to the next.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He scratched his nose thoughtfully and went on: “Besides, who is to say it’s not all for the best? Who is going to make the social revolution if it’s not the swindlers, the wretched, the murderers, the cheats, all the scum that suffer here below without the slightest sign of hope? Or do you reckon it’s the penpushers and the shopkeepers who are going to make the revolution?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All right, all right … but while he’s waiting for the revolution to arrive, what does that poor unfortunate do? What do I do?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain gripped Ergueta’s arm and shouted at him: “Because I’m only a step away from prison, you know. I’ve stolen 600 pesos and seven cents.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist gave a slow wink of his left eye and replied: “Don’t get so upset. The times of tribulation that the scriptures speak of are upon us. Didn’t I marry the Cripple, the Harlot? Hasn’t the son been divided against the father, the father against the son? The revolution is closer than men could wish. Aren’t you the deceiver, the wolf which tears at the flock …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just tell me … couldn’t you see your way to lending me the 600 pesos?” Ergueta shook his head slowly. “D’you think just because I read the Bible I’m a dolt?” Erdosain stared at him in despair: “I swear to you that’s what I owe.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All at once something unforeseen happened.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist stood up, clicked his fingers dismissively, and while the waiter looked on in astonishment, growled at Erdosain:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Get lost, you bum, get lost.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Scarlet with shame, Erdosain slunk away. When he reached the corner and looked back, Ergueta was waving his arms about as he talked to the waiter.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-51" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-8" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897202155248" class="calibre10"></a>
     HATRED <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain’s life was bleeding away. All his pent-up despair drained out towards the horizon he glimpsed beyond telephone cables and trolley-bus wires; he suddenly had the feeling he was treading on his anguish as if it were a carpet. Just as horses who have had their guts ripped out by a bull slither about in their own intestines, so every step that Erdosain took left him with a little less lifeblood in his lungs. His breathing came slower and slower; he thought he would never arrive. Where? He had not the faintest idea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He sat on the doorstep of an empty house on Piedras. He stayed there for several minutes, then got up and began to walk so quickly the sweat poured down his face as though it was a boiling hot day.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He reached the comer of Cerrito and Lavalle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Plunging his hand into his pocket, he discovered a fistful of notes, so he slipped into the Japanese bar. Cabbies and thugs were clustered round the tables. A negro with a wing collar and black rope sandals was picking nits out of his armpit, and three Polish pimps, wearing huge gold rings on their fingers, were busy discussing brothels and madams in their own slang. In one corner several taxi drivers were playing cards. The negro delousing himself looked round him, as if inviting everyone to check his progress, but nobody paid him any attention.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain ordered a coffee, held his head in his hands and stared down at the counter. “Where can I get those 600 pesos?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then he thought of Gregorio Barsut, his wife’s cousin.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All at once Ergueta’s rejection was forgotten. Erdosain conjured up a mental picture of this other man, Gregorio Barsut, with his shaved head, bony bird of prey nose, his green-tinged eyes and pointed wolf ears. The image made his hands tremble and left his throat dry. He would ask him for money that same night. He was bound to turn up as usual around half-past nine. Erdosain pictured him there, gabbling vague excuses for his visit, torrents of words that engulfed Erdosain like rushing sand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He remembered how Barsut would go on endlessly, jumping with feverish agility from one topic to another, fixing his depraved gaze on Erdosain who, mouth parched and hands trembling, did not have the courage to throw him out of the house.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Gregorio Barsut must have been aware of the revulsion he caused in Erdosain, because more than once he had said to him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My conversation isn’t much to your liking, is it?” &mdash; not that this in any way stopped him being an annoyingly frequent visitor to their home.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain always quickly denied the charge, and tried to give the impression he was interested in the other man’s chatter, which went on aimlessly hour after hour, while the whole time Barsut stared at the south-east corner of the room. What on earth did he mean by doing that? At such unpleasant moments, Erdosain consoled himself with the thought that Barsut lived consumed by jealousy and suffered terribly for no apparent reason.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">One night, on one of the rare occasions that Erdosain’s wife had not locked herself in the next room to avoid having to listen to them, Gregorio said: “How amazing it would be if I went mad and shot you both, then killed myself too!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His slant eyes were still fixed on the south-east corner of the room. He smiled and showed his pointed teeth, as if to dismiss what he had said as a joke. But Elsa looked at him grim-faced and replied: “Let that be the last time you say such a thing in my house. Otherwise, you’ll never set foot here again.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Gregorio tried to apologise. But Elsa left and they did not see her again that night.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two men carried on talking. Barsut was paler than ever, his low forehead a mass of nervous twitches, and he kept running his broad hand through the bristles of his bronze-coloured hair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could find no explanation for the hatred Barsut inspired in him. He imagined him to be a coarse, vulgar man, but this did not tally with certain dreams Gregorio had, which revealed a strange, ill-defined but delicate nature governed by the most inexplicable feelings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sometimes though, his apparent or real vulgarity became openly repugnant, and Erdosain had to bite back his indignation with a twist of his pallid lips, while Barsut poured out indescribable obscenities for the sole pleasure of wounding the other man’s sensibility.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Theirs was an invisible, underhand duel, fought without any immediate aim, but so unnerving that whenever Barsut left, Erdosain swore he would not receive him the next day. Yet a few hours before nightfall, Erdosain found himself already thinking of him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Often Barsut arrived and started talking even before he had sat down: “Know something? I had the strangest dream last night.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Unsmiling, his gaze fixed on the south-east corner of the room, an almost doleful expression on his face grimy with a three days’ beard, Barsut launched into a tedious monologue that revealed the terrors a twenty-seven-year-old may have: for example how he had been scared by a one-eyed fish winking at him in the dream, then how he had linked the one-eyed fish to the snooping gaze of an ancient madam hooked on spiritualism who was trying to get him to marry her daughter, and then spinning out his conversation in so many absurd directions that soon Erdosain forgot his loathing and instead wondered if the other man were not stark, staring mad. While Erdosain listened, paralysed and deeply disturbed, Elsa sat sewing in the next room, oblivious to it all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could feel a quiver of impatience setting his knuckles knocking, and the effort he made to conceal this spasm exhausted him. It was only with the utmost difficulty that he could get out any words at all, as if his lips were stuck together with glue.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Propping himself up at the table on one elbow, and straightening the crease in his trousers with the other hand, Barsut sometimes complained that nobody loved him. He stared straight at Erdosain as he said this. At other times, he scoffed at his own fears &mdash; and at a ghost he said he saw in the corner of the lavatory of his rooming-house, the ghost of a giant woman with bony arms, who carried a broom, and stared at him like a harpy. On other evenings he admitted that if he was not already a sick man he would end up being so. Feigning concern for his state of health, Erdosain would enquire about the symptoms and recommend he rest and stay in bed; once, when he insisted, Barsut maliciously retorted: “Does my being here bother you that much?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Other nights Barsut was sinisterly cheerful when he came in, like some sour drunk who has set fire to a petrol station. He would reel around the dining-room, slapping Erdosain on the back so often it set his teeth on edge, and asking him over and over: “How’s it going? How are you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut’s eyes would flash, while Erdosain stood there forlorn and hunched, wondering what it was that so inhibited him in the other man’s presence, like now as he sat perched on the edge of his chair, still relentlessly spying out the corner of the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They always avoided each other’s eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There was an ill-defined, obscure link between them, of the kind that two men who heartily loathe each other endure for reasons they cannot fathom.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain hated Barsut, but with an insipid, cowardly rancour made up of wicked fantasies and even more terrible possibilities. And his hatred was all the more intense for not having any specific focus.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sometimes he found himself imagining a ghastly revenge, and he frowned deeply as he conjured up the worst catastrophes. But the following day when Barsut knocked at the street door, Erdosain would tremble like an adulterous woman caught out by her husband, and he once even flew into a rage at Elsa because she was slow in opening it, commenting in a way aimed at disguising his cowardice: “He’ll think we don’t want to invite him in. If that’s the case, we should tell him not to come any more.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Lacking any real motive, this subterranean loathing spread in Erdosain like a cancer. Barsut’s every gesture gave him an excuse to feel outraged, to wish him a horrible death. And as if sensing these feelings, Barsut seemed unconsciously to respond in the most revolting way. Erdosain never forgot the following instance:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was one evening when they had gone out for a cocktail. With their drinks, the waiter brought a plate of potato salad and mustard. Barsut stuck the toothpick so greedily into a piece of potato that he spilt the salad all over the marble table-top, filthy from cigarette ash and other people’s dirty hands. Erdosain watched in disgust as Barsut mockingly scooped up the salad piece by piece, and then when he reached the last one, smeared it in the mustard spilt on the marble, and popped it in his mouth with an ironic smile.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why don’t you lick the table-top?” Erdosain observed with distaste. Barsut threw him a wild, provocative glance. Then he bent over and licked the whole marble top spotless.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Satisfied?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had turned white.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you gone crazy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s the matter? Don’t tell me you’re upset.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then all at once Barsut burst out laughing and was all smiles again, suddenly released from the fury that had gripped him all evening. Soon he got up and continued talking his usual nonsense.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain never forgot that sight: the bronze bristles of Barsut’s head bent over the marble top, a tongue stuck in the viscous grime of the yellow stone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He often thought that Barsut must hate him because of all he had confided in him. And yet he could not contain himself &mdash; no sooner did he arrive at Erdosain’s house than he began to pour out his unhappiness by the bucketful into his host’s ear, even though he knew this only made Erdosain rejoice all the more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The fact was that Remo drew out these confessions, encouraging them with a fleeting but real compassion which made Barsut’s hatred of him dissolve whenever he offered serious advice. But the loathing came rushing back whenever he caught one of Erdosain’s rapid, furtive glances which showed his pity had given way to an evil glee at the proof of Barsut’s miserable existence because although he had enough money to get by without working, Barsut was terrified at the thought he might go insane as his father and brothers had done before him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly, Erdosain straightened up. The negro with the wing collar had stopped picking at himself; the three pimps were sharing out bundles of money while the cab drivers at the other table shot them avid looks out of the corner of their eyes. The negro was staring so pathetically at the pimps it seemed as though the magic of the money was about to make him sneeze.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stood up and paid. Then he left, saying to himself: “If Gregorio fails, I’ll ask the Astrologer for the money.”</div>

     THE INVENTOR’S DREAMS <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">If anyone had forewarned Erdosain that a few hours later he would be plotting to kill Barsut and that he would be watching passively as his wife left him, he would never have believed it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He wandered around the whole afternoon. He needed to be on his own, to forget human voices and to feel as cut off from all that surrounded him as someone who has missed his train in a strange city.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He walked along the lonely arcades of Arenales and Talcahuano, the corners of Charcas and Rodríguez Peña, the crossroads at Montevideo and Quintana, enjoying this magnificent architectural spectacle for ever denied to the poor and wretched. Leaves from the plane trees crunched under his feet as he stared up at the rounded panes of the huge windows, silvered by the gleaming white of their lace curtains. This was a world far from the brutish city he knew, another world he could feel his heart yearning for with a slow, heavy, beat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He came to a halt to peer at garages as splendid as silver dishes for mass, or the green plumes of cypresses protected behind crenellated walls, or railings thick enough to stop a charging lion. Red gravel curled among ovals of green flowerbeds. Occasionally a governess in a grey cap strolled along a garden path.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And he owed 600 pesos and seven cents!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He stared fascinated at balustrades highlighting black balconies with the round warmth of gold, at windows painted pearl grey or café-au-lait, at panes of glass so thick they must make all passers-by look as if they were walking underwater, at lace curtains so flimsy even their names must be as fascinating as the geography of distant lands. How different love must be in the shade of those tulle curtains, filtering the light and softening every sound …!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But he owed 600 pesos and seven cents. And the pharmacist’s words reverberated in his ears: “You’re right … the world is full of riff-raff … of unhappy wretches … but what’s to be done about it? … How can we present the sacred truths anew to these faithless people …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Like one of those plants whose growth is stimulated by electric light, despair sprouted from deep within his chest until it almost choked him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Standing there, it seemed to Erdosain that each worry was an owl that flitted from one branch of his suffering to the next. He owed 600 pesos and seven cents, and even though he tried to forget it by pinning his hopes on Barsut or the Astrologer, his thoughts drifted off again down a dark street. Strings of lights were hung from the rooftops. Below, a cloud of dust filled the black well of the street. Yet he was walking towards a land of happiness, with the Sugar Company behind him. What had he done with his life? Was this the moment to ask himself the question? How could he walk if his body was a deadweight of seventy kilos? Or was he simply a ghost, recalling events that had happened during its life on earth?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So many things were rushing around deep inside him! What to make of the pharmacist who had married a prostitute? And Barsut, pursued by the one-eyed fish and the spiritualist’s daughter? And Elsa, who would not surrender herself to him, but threatened to throw him out? Was he mad or not?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He asked himself this because there were moments when a strange hope sprang up in him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He imagined that through a spyhole in the blinds of one of these magnificent palaces, a “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” (those were Erdosain’s exact words) was examining him through a pair of opera glasses.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The strange thing was that when Erdosain thought the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” might be observing him, he put on a sorrowful, intent expression and stopped looking at the legs of maids passing by, pretending to be caught up in a tremendous inner tussle. He put on this show because he reckoned that if the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” saw him looking at maids’ legs, he would conclude he was not sufficiently troubled to merit his compassion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain even went so far as to believe that having seen the countless years of suffering etched into the taut muscles of his face, the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” might send for him at any moment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This obsession grew so strong this particular afternoon that he was even suddenly convinced that a flunkey in a red and yellow striped waistcoat who was staring at him brazenly from a hotel door must be the go-between for the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then the butler called him. He followed. He walked across a garden full of spiky cactuses, they went into a large room, where he was left alone for a few minutes. The whole building was in darkness. A single lamp shone in a comer of the room. On the piano bracket, music sheets gave off a scent that showed they were always played by female hands. A woman’s marble bust stood neglected on the sill of a window draped in purple. The cushions on the easy chairs were covered with material like Cubist paintings, and on the desk were burnished bronze ashtrays and a small harlequin statue.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When in his life had Erdosain ever been in a room like the one that now appeared in his imagination? He had no recollection of it. Nevertheless, he saw a huge ebony frame with parallel borders that rose towards a gleaming white ceiling. Its plaster glow lit a marine landscape depicting a dreary wooden bridge beneath whose gigantic arches toiled a mass of indistinct figures, blotched with rusty shadows as they hauled along huge loads, against the background of a bloody, cast-iron sea out of which in the distance loomed a stone wharf cluttered with an assortment of cranes, rails and capstans.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This was the room Elsa had glided through when she was his fiancee. Yes, perhaps, but why recall it now? He was the swindler, the man with the down-at-heel boots, the ragged tie, the greasestained suit, the man who earned his living in the street while his sick wife had to take in laundry. He was all this and nothing more. That was why the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” had sent for him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Carried away by his fantasy &mdash; which had become almost real thanks to the scenes and images recreated by his great, invisible benefactor &mdash; Erdosain could scarcely be bothered to linger over the details of his meeting with the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” who was offering him the money to put his inventions into practice but, like those readers of thrillers who in their hurry to reach the climax of the plot skip the “boring bits”, he omitted several less interesting episodes his imagination suggested, and portrayed himself as out on the street once more, even though that was where he actually was.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At that, leaving the corner of Charcas and Talcahuano, or Arenales and Rodriguez Pena, he would stride off purposefully agam.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The depths of despair gave way to the wildest hopes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He would triumph &mdash; yes, he would! With the money from the “melancholy, taciturn millionaire” he would set up an electrical laboratory, where he would dedicate himself to the study of betarays, the cordless transmission of energy and electro-magnetic currents. He would grow old, like the absurd character in an English novel, without losing his youth; the only sign would be that his face grew gradually whiter until it took on the pale sheen of marble, while his flashing wizard’s eyes would seduce every young woman on earth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Night was falling, and Erdosain suddenly remembered that the only one who could save him from his dreadful predicament was the Astrologer. This thought drove everything else from his mind. Perhaps he had money. Erdosain even suspected he might be a bolshevik agent sent to spread communist propaganda in Argentina, because he had an extraordinary plan to set up a revolutionary society. Without hesitating, Erdosain hailed a cab and told the driver to take him to Constitución station. There he bought a ticket to Temperley.</div>

     THE ASTROLOGER <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The house the Astrologer lived in stood at the centre of a weekend farm. Its red tiles were visible from far away through the surrounding trees. In the clearings between their weighty trunks, deep in huge waves of grasses and creepers, fat, black-rumped insects spent the entire day buzzing about in a constant shower of weeds and stalks. Not far from the house, the three blades of a wind-pump limped round on its rusty iron support, while further off, the blue and red glass panes of a stable door shone dully. Behind the wind-pump and the house, on the other side of low walls, loomed the dark bottle-green crests of a eucalyptus grove, silhouetted against a navy-blue sky.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Chewing on a honeysuckle, Erdosain strode across to the house. He felt as if he were far from the city, in the middle of the countryside, and the sight of the building came as a relief. Although it had a low outline, it had two floors, with a crumbling balcony around the top floor, and a ridiculous Greek column affair at the entrance, approached by steps flanked by palm trees.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The red tiles angled down so that the house eaves sheltered the attic skylights and small windows; through the dainty foliage of chestnut trees, above pomegranate trees starred with their scarlet asterisks, a zinc weathervane swung its twisted tail at the mercy of the winds. The subtleties of the garden, laid out like a grove, unfolded all around Erdosain. In the still evening air, with the sun lending a mother-of-pearl sheen to everything, the rose bushes gave off such a strong and penetrating scent that it seemed the whole garden was tinged with a red shimmer as cool as a mountain stream.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain thought:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Even if I had a silver boat with golden sails and ivory oars and the ocean shone with seven colours, and a millionairess was blowing me kisses from the moon, I would still be as sad as I am now … But what am I saying? I could live better here than in the city. Here at least I could have a laboratory.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A leaky tap dripped into a barrel. A dog lay dozing at the front of a summerhouse &mdash; and when Erdosain stopped to call out from the foot of the steps, the giant figure of the Astrologer soon appeared in the doorway, dressed in a yellow smock and with his hat tilted forward over his brow so that his broad flat face was in shadow. A few stray curls hung down the sides of his face, and his nose, broken in the middle, was squashed to the left in an extraordinary fashion. A pair of round, darting black eyes shone from beneath bushy eyebrows, and this, together with the harsh lines scouring his rough cheeks, made it look as if the Astrologer’s face was sculpted in lead. How heavy that head must have been!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, it’s you, is it? Come in. You can meet the Melancholy Thug.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They crossed a dark and dank hallway and went into a study decorated with a faded green flowered wallpaper.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Cobwebs dangling from the high ceiling, and the studded grille covering the narrow window gave the room a frankly sinister look. In one corner, the metalwork of an old-fashioned wardrobe refracted the bluish atmosphere into dark and light shadows. A man dressed in grey was sitting in a threadbare green velvet armchair. A shock of dark hair hung down his forehead; he was wearing tan spats. As he approached this stranger, the Astrologer’s smock billowed out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Erdosain, let me introduce you to Arturo Haffner.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">On another occasion, the swindler would have enjoyed a long talk with the man whom in private the Astrologer called The Melancholy Thug, and who now, after shaking hands with Erdosain, crossed his legs in the armchair and leaned his blue-tinged cheek on three fingers with manicured nails. Erdosain took stock of his almost perfectly round, relaxed face, where only the mocking, evasive gleam deep in his eyes and the habit of raising one eyebrow when listening betrayed that he was a man of action. Between the jacket and the silk shirt the Thug was wearing, Erdosain caught a glimpse of a black revolver butt. Faces don’t give much of a clue to people, really.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then the Thug turned back to look at a map of the United States of America, which the Astrologer was striding towards, pointer in hand. He stopped in front of it, his yellow arm blocking out the blue Caribbean Sea. He announced:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In Chicago alone, the Ku-Klux-Klan had 150,000 members … In Missouri, 100,000. It’s said that in Arkansas there are more than 200 ‘caverns’. In Little Rock, the Invisible Empire claims that every single Protestant preacher is a member of the brotherhood. In the state of Texas, it enjoys absolute control in the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and Beaumont. In Binghamton, the birthplace of Smith the Great Dragon of the Order, there were 75,000, while in Oklahoma the Klan forced the legislature to pass a bill suspending Governor Walton for attacking them, with the result that until a short while ago the state was practically run by the Klan.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer’s yellow smock looked like a Buddhist monk’s robe.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do you know they burnt a lot of people alive?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes,” the Thug said, “I read the cables.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain considered the Melancholy Thug again. The Astrologer had given him the nickname because once many years earlier the pimp had tried to kill himself. It remained a mysterious episode. From one day to the next, Haffner, who had been living off prostitutes for a long while, suddenly fired a shot into his chest, close to the heart. His life was saved only due to the fact that this organ contracted at the precise moment the bullet whizzed by. After that, naturally enough, he went on with his life as before, perhaps enjoying an even greater reputation in the eyes of his rapacious comrades, none of whom could explain his strange gesture. The Astrologer went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Ku-Klux-Klan collected millions …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Thug stirred and protested:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and the Dragon … some dragon he is! And the Dragon is being tried for embezzlement …” The Astrologer pretended he had not heard: “What is to prevent there being a secret society as powerful as the Klan here in Argentina? I’m telling you honestly &mdash; I don’t know if our society would be bolshevik or fascist. Sometimes I think the best thing would be to concoct such an unholy mixture that not even God could untangle it. I’m being completely frank with you now. For the moment, what I’m aiming for is a huge undefined mass which could accommodate every possible human aspiration. My plan is to target young bolsheviks, students and intelligent proletarians. We will also welcome all those who have some grandiose scheme for reshaping the universe, all those clerks who dream of becoming millionaires, all the failed inventors &mdash; don’t take that personally, Erdosain &mdash; all those who have lost their job, whatever it might have been, those who are being taken to court and have no idea where to turn …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain remembered the mission he had come on, and broke in: “I need to talk to you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just a moment … I’ll be with you right away,” said the Astrologer, and then he went on: “The strength of our society won’t depend so much on what its members donate as on the earnings from the brothel each cell will run. And when I talk of a secret society, I don’t mean the traditional kind, but a super-modern one, in which each member or associate has a stake and earns a profit &mdash; that’s the only way to get them to identify more and more closely with its aims, although these will only really be known to a few. That’s the commercial side of things. The brothels will guarantee enough income to support the growing number of ventures the society undertakes. We’ll set up a revolutionary training camp in the mountains. The new recruits will undergo instruction in anarchist tactics, revolutionary propaganda, military engineering, industrial relations, so that the day they leave the colony they can set up a branch of the society anywhere … D’you follow me? The secret society will have its own academy, the Academy for Revolutionaries.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The clock on the wall struck five. Erdosain felt he had no time to lose, and blurted out: “I’m sorry to interrupt you. I’ve come on important business. Do you have 600 pesos?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer put down his pointer and folded his arms:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s got into you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If I don’t repay the Sugar Company 600 pesos by tomorrow, I’ll go to gaol.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Intrigued, the two men stared at Erdosain. He must really be in a bad way to be begging like this. Erdosain went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You have to help me. Over the past few months I’ve stolen 600 pesos. Someone sent an anonymous letter betraying me. If I don’t return the money tomorrow I’ll be arrested.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How did you steal the money?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Bit by bit …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stroked his beard thoughtfully.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But how did you do it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had to go over the details. Whenever storekeepers were delivered goods, they signed a note promising to pay the value of what they had received. At the end of each month, Erdosain and two other collectors were given these notes, and they had thirty days to recover the money owed. The collectors kept all the notes that had not been cancelled &mdash; according to them &mdash; until such time as the debtor finally paid up. Erdosain continued:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Imagine, our bookkeeper was so careless that he never once checked the vouchers we claimed were unpaid, so that if we did collect the money but kept it back, we could balance the books with the money we got from another account settled later on. D’you follow?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was the apex of the triangle formed by the three seated men. The Melancholy Thug and the Astrologer glanced at each other from time to time. Haffner flicked off the ash from his cigarette, then examined Erdosain from head to toe, one eyebrow raised. Finally, he put him this odd question:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did you get any pleasure from stealing?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, none at all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, how come your boots are such a mess?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I earned hardly anything.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the money you stole?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It never occurred to me to use it to buy shoes with.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This was true. The initial pleasure Erdosain had felt at getting away scot-free with something that was not his had soon evaporated, until one day he discovered in himself the kind of anguish that leads people to see sunny skies as blackened by a soot only visible to a soul in torment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When Erdosain had realised he owed 400 pesos, the shock drove him close to madness. From then on, he spent the money in the most stupid, frenzied ways possible. He bought expensive chocolates although he had never liked them, lunched on crab, turtle soup and frogs’ legs in restaurants where the mere privilege of sitting next to elegant people costs a fortune; he drank expensive liquors and wines that tasted insipid to his untutored palate; and yet he never thought of buying anything he needed for day-to-day living, like underwear, shoes, ties …</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He doled out money freely to beggars, and regularly left extravagant tips for the waiters who served him, in an effort to erase all traces of the stolen money in his pocket, knowing he could replenish it the next day without risk.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So it never occurred to you to buy shoes?” Haffner insisted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now that you come to mention it, it seems odd to me as well, but the truth is I never imagined that stolen money could be used to buy that kind of thing.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So what did you spend it on?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I gave 200 pesos to the Espilas, a family I’m friendly with, so that they could buy an accumulator and set up a galvano-plastics workshop to make a copper rose, which is …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I already know about that …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve told him about it,” the Astrologer explained.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the other 400?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know … I’ve spent it on ridiculous things …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What do you intend to do now?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve no idea.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t you know anyone who could help?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, no-one. Ten days ago I asked a relative of my wife’s, Barsut. He said he couldn’t …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’ll go to gaol then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It seems so.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer turned to the pimp and said: “You know, I have 1,000 pesos. I need it if my project is to get off the ground. All I can offer you, Erdosain, is 300 pesos. But what a mess you’ve got yourself into, haven’t you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At this, Erdosain turned to Haffner as well and burst out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s the despair, you see … that damned feeling of anguish that drags you down …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What d’you mean?” the Thug asked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Anguish is what it’s all about. That’s why you rob, and get in messes like this. You’re walking the streets under a yellow sun that’s like a plague sun … You must have felt the same. Having 5,000 pesos in your wallet, but still feeling crushed. Then all of a sudden a tiny whisper of an idea suggests robbery. That night you’re so overjoyed you can’t sleep. The next day you try it out nervously, and it’s such a success that there’s no other choice but to go on … just like when you tried to kill yourself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As Erdosain said this, Haffner got up and crouched on the chair, clasping his knees in his hands. The Astrologer tried to interrupt Erdosain, but he was having none of it, and rushed on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, just like when you tried to kill yourself. I’ve often pictured it. You’d got bored with being a ponce &mdash; you can’t imagine how much I wanted to meet you! I would say to myself: this must be a really strange guy! Out of 100,000 men who live off women the way you do, there is only one like you. You asked me if I got any pleasure from stealing. What about you: do you enjoy being a pimp? Tell me, do you get any pleasure from it? … Ah, what the hell! I didn’t come here to explain myself. What I need is money, not words.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had stood up, and was nervously twisting the brim of his hat between his fingers. He stared defiantly at the Astrologer, whose hat was blocking out the state of Kansas on the map, and at the Thug, who had slipped his hands into his waistband. Haffner dropped his feet down again out of the threadbare green velvet chair, rested his cheek on his plump fingers, and said coolly, with a sly smile:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sit down, my friend, I’ll give you the 600 pesos.” Erdosain trembled. Then, rooted to the spot, he stared for a long while at the Thug, who repeated, stressing his words: “Sit down and don’t worry. I’ll give you the 600 pesos. That’s what we men are here for.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain did not know what to say. The same emptiness he felt when the man with the boar’s head had told him he could go, that same sad empty feeling gripped him now. So life was not so bad after all!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Let’s do it this way,” the Astrologer said. “I’ll give him 300, and you the other three.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No,” Haffner objected. “You need the money. I don’t. I have three women looking after that.” Then he turned to Erdosain: “See how easily things can be sorted out? Are you satisfied?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He spoke with a wily calm, as confident as a farmer who knows that his experience of nature will always provide him with a way out of even the most complicated situation. It was only now that Erdosain became aware of the overpowering scent of the roses and the sound of the dripping tap through the half-open window. Outside, the paths wound round the house in the afternoon sun, and the birds weighed down the pomegranate trees, starred with their scarlet asterisks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A malicious gleam reappeared in the Thug’s eyes. He awaited Erdosain’s explosion of joy, one eyebrow lifted higher than the other, but when nothing happened, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you been living like this for a long time?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, a long time.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you remember, even though you never said anything to me, I once told you you couldn’t go on living that way?” the Astrologer put in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but I didn’t want to talk about it. I don’t know why, but you don’t share things you can’t explain to yourself with the people you trust the most.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“When are you going to give the money back?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tomorrow.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll write you a cheque now, then. You’ll have to cash it in the morning.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner went over to the bureau. He took his cheque book out of his pocket and wrote the amount with a firm hand, then signed it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was standing stock still, but his mind raced off on a minute-long journey like someone floating through a dream landscape &mdash; the kind of experience that afterwards seems to prove life is shot through with a prescient fatalism.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“At your service, my friend.” Erdosain took the cheque and without looking at it, folded it in four and put it in his pocket. All this had only taken a minute.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What had happened was more unreal than anything written in a novel, but there he was, a man of flesh and blood. A man who did not know what to say. A minute earlier, he had owed 600 pesos and seven cents. Now he didn’t, and this marvel had been achieved by a single gesture from the Thug. According to everyday logic, what had just happened was impossible, and yet it had all seemed so perfectly natural. He wanted to say something. He took stock again of the man slumped in the threadbare velvet armchair. The revolver bulged under the grey jacket while Haffner nonchalantly leant his cheek on three glittering fingernails. He wanted to thank the Thug, but could not find the words to do so. The other man understood; he turned to the Astrologer, who had sat on a stool next to the desk, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So obedience will be one of the main pillars of your society?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And industry. We need gold to capture men’s imaginations. Just as in the past there were the mysticisms of religion and chivalry, so now we have to make industry mystical. To show people it’s just as noble to be in charge of a blast furnace as it was in the past to discover a continent. My politician, my political disciple in the society, will be someone who aims to conquer happiness through industry. This revolutionary will be as much at ease talking about a process for fabric design as about demagnetising steel. That’s why I thought so highly of Erdosain when I met him. His mind worked along the same lines as mine. You remember how often we talked about the way our ideas coincided? Creating a proud, fine, inexorable man who can dominate multitudes and show them a future based on science. How else can a social revolution come about? Today’s leader has to be a man who knows everything. And we shall forge this prince of wisdom. Our society will ensure it creates his legend and spreads it. A Ford or an Edison are a thousand times more likely to bring about a revolution than any politician. Do you think that dictatorships in the future will be military? No, sir. Soldiers are worth nothing compared to industrialists. They may be their tools, but nothing more. Nothing more. Our future dictators will be the kings of oil, steel, of wheat. And our society will prepare the ground for this. We’ll spread our theories everywhere. That’s why we need to study propaganda thoroughly. We have to use men and women students. We have to make science seem attractive, to familiarise people with it so that …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m leaving,” Erdosain said.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was about to say goodbye to Haffner, when the Thug said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll go with you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In that case, I need a word with you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer took him outside, while Erdosain waited. Then the two men came back in, and when Erdosain turned to look back from the gate to the house, he could see the gigantic figure of the Astrologer waving in a gesture of farewell.</div>

     OPINIONS OF THE MELANCHOLY THUG <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">After they had turned the street corner outside the house, Erdosain said: “I don’t know how to thank you for the tremendous favour you’ve done me. Why did you give me the money like that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner, whose shoulders twitched nervously as he walked along, turned to him coldly and replied: “I’ve no idea. You caught me at a good moment. It’d be a different matter if one had to do it every day … but like this … and anyway, remember that I’ll get it back within the week …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could not help asking: “But how is it that with the fortune you have already, you’re still out there pimping?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Angry, Haffner turned to face him, then said: “Look, pimping isn’t something anyone could do. And why should I leave three women who between them bring in 2,000 pesos a month in the lurch? Would you? No. Well then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But don’t you care for them? Isn’t there anyone of them you’re particularly attracted to?” As soon as he had asked the question, Erdosain realised how stupid it was. The pimp stared at him for a moment, then retorted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just listen to me. If a doctor came to me tomorrow and told me: your Basque girl is going to die in a week, whether you take her out of the brothel or not, I’d allow that girl, who’s brought me in 30,000 pesos over the past four years, to work for six days and croak on the seventh.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Thug’s voice had become harsh. There was a certain fierce bitterness to his words, the kind of bitterness that Erdosain would come to recognise in the voice of all the tight-lipped lowlifes, all the bored gangsters he was to meet.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Pity?” the other man went on. “The last thing those whores need is pity. They’re tough, vindictive bitches, that’s what they are. Don’t be astonished, I know what I’m talking about. They only respond to a good beating. Like nine out of ten people, you think the pimp is the one who does the exploiting, and that the girl is the victim. But tell me this: why does a girl need all the money she earns? What the novelists don’t write is that a prostitute who hasn’t got a man is always searching desperately for someone who’ll deceive her, beat up on her from time to time and take all her money, because that’s how dumb they are. It’s been said women are men’s equals. Pure hogwash. Women are inferior to men. Just look at savage tribes. There it’s the women who cook, work and do everything, while the males go hunting or off to fight. It’s the same today. Apart from making money, men do nothing. And make no mistake, a whore will despise any man who doesn’t take her money. Oh yes, as soon as they feel soft on you, the first thing they want is to be asked for money … you can’t imagine how delighted they are the day you say: ‘<em class="calibre11">Ma chérie</em>, could you lend me 100 pesos?’ It’s guaranteed to bowl her over, make her feel good. At last the filthy money she earns is going to a good cause, to making her man happy. Of course, no novelist has ever written that. So people reckon we’re monsters, or zoo animals, as we’re painted in cheap fiction. But if you come and live in our world and get to know it well, you’ll see it’s just the same as our bourgeoisie or our aristocracy. The kept woman looks down on the cabaret artiste, the artiste looks down on the streetwalker, the streetwalker looks down on the girl in a brothel, and what’s most surprising, the brothel girl nearly always chooses a real swine, while the cabaret artiste finds a daddy’s boy or a crooked doctor to run her. You want to know the psychology of a whore? A girl who a friend of mine had dropped put it in a nutshell when she told me in tears: ‘<em class="calibre11">Encore avec mon cul je peux soutenir un homme</em>.’ Ordinary people and novelists don’t know that. But it’s all in a French proverb: ‘<em class="calibre11">Gueuse seule ne peut pas mener son cul.</em>’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stared at him dumbfounded. Haffner went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who looks after her like her pimp? Who takes care of her when she’s ill, or been picked up by the police? What do people know? If one Saturday morning you heard a whore say to her ponce: ‘<em class="calibre11">Mon chéri</em>, I turned fifty more tricks than last week,’ you’d want to be a pimp too, wouldn’t you? Because she says that ‘fifty more tricks’ with just as much pride as an honest woman tells her husband: ‘Darling, this month I managed to save thirty pesos by not buying a new dress and by doing all the laundry myself.’ Take my word for it: women, honest or not, are creatures who like to sacrifice themselves. It’s the way they’re made. Why do you think the Fathers of the Church despised women so much? Most of them had lived in luxury off women, and knew what they were talking about. And whores are worse still. They’re like children: you have to tell them everything. ‘This is where you walk; don’t go past this corner; don’t give that mafioso the time of day. Don’t pick a fight with that woman.’ You have to teach them every single thing.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They were walking along past garden walls, and in the gentle evening air the pimp’s words left Erdosain gasping with shock. He realised he was brushing up against a life totally different from his own. He asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How did you get started?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was when I was young. I was twenty-three and a maths professor. That’s what I am,” Haffner explained proudly, “a mathematics professor. I was making my living teaching, when one night in a brothel on Rincon I met a young French girl I liked a lot. That was ten years ago. Just around that time I had inherited 5,000 pesos from a relative. I liked Lucienne, and asked her to come and live with me. She had a pimp, a huge brute of a fellow known as the Marsellais, who she saw occasionally. I don’t know whether it was my sweet talk or my looks, but the fact is she fell in love with me, and one stormy night I sneaked her out of the whorehouse. Talk about a drama! First we went to the hills in Cordoba, then to the seaside at Mar del Plata, and when we’d spent the whole 5,000, I told her: ‘Well, that’s the end of the idyll. It’s all over.’ But she said: ‘No, sweetheart, you and I will never part.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By now the two men were walking under leafy arches, intertwined branches and apses of greenery.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And I was jealous. Can you imagine what it’s like to be jealous of a woman who sleeps with everyone? Or how you feel at the first lunch she pays for with money from a sugar daddy? To eat with the wrong fork while the waiter looks at you both, realising what’s going on? Or the pleasure of going out into the street with her on your arm while the cops size you up? Or knowing that this woman, who sleeps with so many men, likes you, and only you? It’s a great feeling, I can tell you, when you’re with a streetwalker. And she’s the one who sees to it that you get another girl to use, she’s the one who brings her home, saying ‘we’re going to be sisters-in-law,’ she’s the one who breaks the new filly in so that she only turns tricks for you &mdash; and the more embarrassed and ashamed you are, the greater pleasure she gets from undermining your scruples, from bringing you down to her level, until suddenly … when you least suspect it, you’re up to your neck in filth … and that’s when the game really starts. And you have to take advantage while she’s stuck on you, because one fine day she’ll go crazy and fall for some other guy, and then in the same blind way she followed you, she’ll rush off again to the sacrifice. You might say: why does a woman need a man? But I tell you straight off: no brothel owner will deal with a woman. They always want to do business with her pimp. And the pimp’s the one who gives her peace of mind so that she can get on with her life. The cops don’t bother her. If she’s arrested, he gets her out; if she falls ill, he takes her to a clinic to be looked after; he keeps her out of trouble and does a thousand other unbelievable things just for her. Look, any woman who tries to work on her own in the business ends up either being assaulted, robbed or caught up in some other nasty affair. But a girl who’s protected by a man can work in peace, she’s no problems, nobody tries any funny stuff, everyone respects her. And since &mdash; for whatever reasons &mdash; she chose the life she’s leading, there’s no reason why she shouldn’t use her money to buy all the happiness she craves.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, all this is new to you, but you’ll get used to the idea. And if you don’t agree, just explain how one ‘pimp’ can have as many as seven women. When that wop Repollo was in full swing, he had eleven girls working for him. And Julio the Dago had eight. Nearly all the Frenchies have three women. And not only do they all know each other, but they even live together, and compete to see who can give their man the most, because it’s an honour for them to be the favourite of someone who with a single glance can protect them from the toughest raid. And besides, the poor creatures are so crazy that you never know whether to feel sorry for them or to split their heads open with a blackjack.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt overwhelmed by the other man’s incredible contempt for women. He remembered how once the Astrologer had told him: “the Melancholy Thug is the kind of guy who when he sees a woman, the first thing he thinks is: ‘on the street, this filly would bring in five, ten or twenty pesos’. And nothing else.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain began to feel repelled by him. To change the conversation, he said: “OK, but tell me … d’you think the Astrologer’s scheme will work?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Does he know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So why do you go along with him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I only go along with him up to a certain point, and then simply because I’m so bored with everything. Life has no meaning, so why not follow whichever way the wind blows?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So life has no meaning for you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Absolutely none. We’re born, we live, we die, but that doesn’t stop the stars spinning round or ants getting on with their work.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you’re really bored?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So-so. I’ve planned out my life like an industrialist. Every day I go to bed at midnight and get up at nine in the morning. I do exercises for an hour, take a bath, read the newspapers, have lunch, sleep a siesta. Then at six I drink a cocktail and visit the barber. I dine at eight, then go out to a café, and two years from now when I’ve made 200,000 pesos, I’ll retire from the game and live for the rest of my life on my income.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s your role in the Astrologer’s secret society meant to be then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If he finds the money, I’ll help him find the girls and set up the brothel.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But what d’you really think of the Astrologer deep down?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That he’s a lunatic who may or may not succeed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But his ideas …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Some of them are confused, others seem clear, but frankly I don’t know what he’s really aiming at. Sometimes it’s like listening to a reactionary, at others he sounds like a Red, and to tell you the truth I don’t think even he knows what he wants.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And if he does succeed?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then God only knows what could happen! Oh, by the way, was it you who thought up the idea of cultivating Asiatic cholera bacillae?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … it would be a fantastic weapon against an army. Imagine releasing one batch in each army barracks. Thirty or forty men could destroy the army at a stroke and pave the way for the proletarian masses to make the revolution …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Astrologer thinks very highly of you. He’s always talked of you as someone who’s going to go a long way.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain grinned with pleasure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, we have to think of some way to destroy this society. But returning to what we were saying before: what I can’t grasp is your position with regard to the rest of us …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner turned quickly towards Erdosain, looked him up and down as though surprised at his manner of speaking, then said with a mocking grin:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m not in any position, as you call it. You have to understand that helping the Astrologer is no skin off my nose. Beyond that, to me all his theories are so much hot air. He’s simply a friend who’s going to set up a business that’s legally accepted. That’s all. It’s the same to me whether he puts the money he makes from that business into a secret society or into a convent. So as you can see, any part I play in the famous society will be a completely disinterested one.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But does it seem logical to you to base a revolutionary society on the exploitation of women through vice?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Thug curled his lip. Then, shooting Erdosain a sideways glance, he replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re talking nonsense. Our present-day society is based on the exploitation of men, women and children. If you want to see what capitalist exploitation is really like, go take a look at the steelworks in Avellaneda, the meat-packing plants, the glassworks, or the match or tobacco factories.” He snickered unpleasantly as he said this. “Those of us who run girls have one or two of them; but industrialists control a whole mass of human beings. What would be the best name for them? And who is more heartless, a brothel owner or the shareholders of a large company? To look no further, didn’t they expect you to be honest on a wage of 100 pesos while you were carting around 10,000 in your wallet?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re right … but why did you give me the money then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s a different kettle of fish.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But I’d like to know.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, be seeing you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And before Erdosain could even reply, the other man had turned off down a leafy street. He was walking quickly. Erdosain stared after him for a moment, then started in pursuit. He caught him by the next corner. Haffner whirled round angrily, and shouted at him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you mind telling me exactly what you want from me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What I want? … I want to tell you this: that I haven’t the faintest intention of thanking you for the money you’ve given me. D’you want your cheque back? Here it is.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he spoke, Erdosain held out the cheque, but the Thug just sneered at him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t be so ridiculous. Go and pay your debt.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The roadside walls wavered in front of Erdosain’s eyes. He was suffering so visibly that he turned a bright yellow. He leaned against a lamp-post, thinking he was about to vomit. Haffner came to a halt a few yards ahead and asked him sarcastically: “Getting over the dizzy spell?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … a bit …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re not well … you should see a doctor …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They walked on a few yards in silence. The lights were shining too brightly for Erdosain, so they crossed to the other side of the street which was in shadow. Eventually they reached the train station. Haffner paced up and down the platform. All of a sudden he turned to Erdosain:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you ever been tempted to behave as cruelly as you could towards someone?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, sometimes …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s strange … I was just remembering the time when I was determined to turn a blind girl into a prostitute …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is she still around?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, she’s the daughter of a corset-maker. She’s only seventeen. I don’t know why, but she brings out the most savage fantasies in me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Does she still work for you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and now she’s pregnant. Can you imagine? Blind and pregnant. I’ll take you to see her one of these days. You can meet her. She’s an interesting sight, I can tell you. Can you imagine? Blind and pregnant. And quite crazy, always sticking needles in her hands … plus she’s as greedy as a pig. You’ll be fascinated.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you think …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, when the Astrologer sets up his brothel, she’ll be the first one I’ll put in. We’ll keep her a secret: she can be the surprise package we offer.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re a lot weirder than her, d’you know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Eh?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Because you’re so hard to grasp. While you were talking about the blind girl, I was thinking of a story the Astrologer told me about you. That once you had met an honest woman, and by chance she ended up in your house, but you respected her. More than that &mdash; no, let me say it &mdash; this woman loved you, and she was a virgin, but you didn’t touch her.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s beside the point. A little self-control, that’s all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the story of the necklace?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">From the Astrologer, Erdosain knew that the Thug had once asked a dancer for a token of her affection for him; and that in the midst of a group of women, she had taken off a magnificent necklace given her by her lover, an old textile importer. The scene was all the odder because the lover was also present. Haffner took the necklace and then to everyone’s astonishment weighed it in his hand, examined the stones, then gave it back with a wry smile.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, that’s simple enough,” Haffner replied. “I was a bit drunk. But not enough not to realise that what I was doing would win me undying prestige among all that cabaret riffraff, especially the women, who are full of romantic notions. And the strangest thing of all was that half an hour later the old guy who had given Renee the necklace came up to me to humbly thank me for not accepting it. Can you imagine? He had seen the whole thing from a nearby table, where he sat quaking in his boots &mdash; but he’d done nothing because he was afraid of causing a scandal. What he was so worried about was what might happen to his necklace … how low can you get? Anyway, here’s the train to La Plata. See you soon … oh, yes, and make sure you don’t miss the meeting at the Astrologer’s next Wednesday. You’ll meet far more interesting people than me there.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Deep in thought, Erdosain crossed over to the platform for Buenos Aires. No doubt about it, Haffner was a monster.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-55" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897201983808" class="calibre10"></a>
     HUMILIATION <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">He reached home at eight that night.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There was a light on in the dining-room … but let me explain,” Erdosain told me: “my wife and I were in such dire straits that what we called the dining-room was simply a room almost empty of furniture. The other one was our bedroom. You might ask why if we were so poor we rented a house, but it was something my wife insisted on &mdash; she remembered happier days and could not get used to the idea of not ‘setting up home’.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The only piece of furniture in the dining-room was a pine table. Across one corner of the room was a wire we used to hang our clothes from, in another stood a trunk with tin clasps that gave the impression we led a nomadic life that would one day end with the final journey. Later on, I have often thought of that ‘sense of a journey’ the cheap trunk in the corner of our room created in the desperate mind of a man who knew himself to be at the gates of prison.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“As I was saying, there was a light on. As soon as I opened the door, I froze. My wife was waiting for me, dressed to go out. She was sitting at the table, and wore a black tulle hat with a veil down over her rosy cheeks. A suitcase lay to the right of her feet, and, on the far side of the table, a man got up as I came in, or rather, as I stood paralysed with shock in the doorway.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“For a second, none of us moved … The Captain standing there, one hand on the table and the other on the pommel of his sword, my wife’s eyes lowered to the floor, and me gaping at the two of them, still grasping the edge of the door. That second was enough for me never to forget the man. He was tall, and his firm, athletic build showed through his uniform. As his eyes left my wife, they took on a curious hardness. I am not exaggerating when I say he stared at me insolently, as if I were of a lower rank. I stared back at him. His sturdy physique contrasted with his small oval face, his delicate nose, and austere, thin lips. On his chest he wore the badge of an airforce pilot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My first words were:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘What’s going on here?’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘This gentleman …’ but then Elsa blushed and corrected herself. ‘Remo,’ she said, calling me by my first name, ‘Remo, I can’t live with you any more.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain did not even have time to react before the Captain went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Your wife, whom I met some time ago …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And where exactly did you meet her?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What kind of a question is that?” Elsa put in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right,” the Captain protested. “As you must know, there are certain things one doesn’t ask.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain flushed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You may be right … I’m sorry …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And since you don’t earn enough to keep her …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain squeezed the revolver butt in his trouser pocket and stared at the Captain. Then the thought that he had nothing to fear made him smile unintentionally: he could easily kill him if he wanted to.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t see anything funny in what I’m saying.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, it was just something silly that crossed my mind … so she told you that as well?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and she also said you were a frustrated genius …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We talked about your inventions …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, your scheme for making metal flowers …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why are you leaving then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m tired, Remo.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could feel rage twisting his mouth in curses. He would have insulted her, but the thought that the Captain could easily thrash him kept him in check. He simply said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’ve always been tired. You were tired at your parents’ house … and here … even in the mountains … d’you remember?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Nonplussed, Elsa merely nodded.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tired … what have you got to be tired about? … All women seem to be tired … I’ve no idea why, but they’re tired … What about you, Captain, aren’t you tired too?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The interloper looked him up and down.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What exactly do you mean by tiredness?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Boredom, anguish … have you noticed we seem to be in the times of tribulation the Bible speaks of? That’s what a friend of mine who’s married a cripple calls it. The cripple is the harlot of the Gospels …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve never given it any thought.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have, though. You may think it’s odd for me to talk of suffering in these circumstances … but that’s the way things are … men are so sad they need to be humiliated by someone.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I can’t see that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, with what you earn … What do you earn, by the way? Five hundred?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Something like that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, earning that much it’s logical …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s logical?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That you don’t feel trapped.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Captain’s hard eyes settled on Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t listen to him, Germán,” Elsa interrupted. “Remo is always going on about anguish like that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is that so?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … whereas she believes in being happy, the kind of ‘eternal happiness’ she would feel if she could spend the whole time enjoying herself …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I hate being unhappy.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, because you don’t believe in unhappiness … the dreadful unhappiness that’s inside us, deep down … the unhappiness of the soul which eats at our bones like syphilis.” They fell silent. Visibly bored, the Captain was examining his carefully polished nails.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa stared through her veil at the gaunt face of a husband she had once loved so deeply, while Erdosain himself was trying to puzzle out why there was such a huge void inside him, a void that engulfed his consciousness, leaving him incapable of finding the words to howl out the eternal suffering he felt.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All at once the Captain looked up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How do you intend to make your metal flowers?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s easy … you take a rose, for example, and plunge it into a silver nitrate solution dissolved in alcohol. Then you expose the flower to light, which transforms the nitrate to a metal, so that the rose is now covered with a thin film of silver which acts as a conductor. Then you apply the ordinary galvano-plastic method of copperplating to it … and there you have it, the flower is now a copper rose. The process could be applied in lots of ways.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s an original idea.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Didn’t I tell you, Germán, that Remo is talented?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I can see that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I may be talented, but what I lack is life … enthusiasm … some kind of overwhelming dream … a great illusion that would drive me on to accomplish it … anyway, to change the subject, do you two hope to be happy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They fell silent again. Their three faces were like wax masks in the yellow light from the bulb. Erdosain realised that in a few short minutes everything would be over. Gnawing at his despair, he asked the Captain:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why did you come here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The other man hesitated, then said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I wanted to meet you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did you think it would be fun?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Captain flushed. “No … I swear to you, I didn’t.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was curious. Your wife has told me a lot about you over the past few weeks. Besides, I never thought I’d be in a situation like this … when it comes down to it, I’ve no idea why I came.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You see? There are things we can’t explain. I for example have been trying to explain to myself why I don’t shoot you dead since I’ve got a revolver here in my pocket.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa looked up at Erdosain, who was standing at the head of the table … The Captain asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s holding you back?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The truth is, I don’t know … or perhaps … yes, I’m sure this is the reason. I think each of us has a line of fate in their heart. It’s like being able to divine things thanks to some mysterious instinct. I feel everything that’s happening to me now is already marked on that line of fate … as if I had seen it all before … but I don’t know where …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What are you saying?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s as if you’re not the one who’s caused this … no … like I say, I had a strange feeling it was bound to happen.” “I don’t understand you.” “But I understand myself. It’s like this. All of a sudden you get the feeling that certain things are destined to happen in your life … so that it can change and renew itself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you think your life will …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ignoring the question, Erdosain interrupted the Captain:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What I mean is, none of this surprises me. If you told me to go and buy you a pack of cigarettes &mdash; by the way, do you have one?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Help yourself … what then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know. My life has been pretty chaotic lately … I’ve been paralysed by this feeling of anguish. And you can see how calmly I’m talking to you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, Remo was always expecting something extraordinary to happen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So were you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What &mdash; you too, Elsa?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But he’s wrong, isn’t he, Elsa?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you think so?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell the truth, you’re also looking for something extraordinary to take you out of all this, aren’t you?” “I don’t know.” “You see, Captain? That’s how our life together always was. The two of us sitting in silence at this table here …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Be quiet!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What for? We’d be sitting here, and we’d understand without saying a word that we were two people with no hope, linked by an unequal love. And when we went to bed …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Remo!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Señor Erdosain!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t pretend to be prudish … don’t you two go to bed together?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If you talk like that, there’s nothing more to say.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, so then afterwards we’d both feel the same: is that all there is to the pleasures of life and love? … and again, without saying a word, we’d realise we both felt the same … but, to change the subject, are you thinking of staying here in the city?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’ll be going to Spain for a while.” His words triggered an icy vision of a journey in Erdosain’s mind. He could see Elsa leaning on a handrail beneath a row of glassy portholes, gazing at the blue line of the horizon. The sun glinted off the yellow foremasts and the black winch arms. It was late afternoon, but the two of them stood at the white rails in the lee of the cabins, their minds intent on distant climes. The iodine wind ruffled the waves as Elsa stared down at her shadow flickering on the shifting lattices of the water.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">From time to time she turned her pallid face to her companion, and it seemed they both could hear a voice of reproach rising from the depths of the ocean.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Erdosain imagined the voice was saying: “What have you done to the poor boy?” (“Because even at my age, I was like a boy” &mdash; Remo told me later on &mdash; “D’you see, a man who lets his wife be stolen from under his nose … he must be pitiful … he’s like a little boy, d’you see?”)</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain jerked out of his hallucination. His next question rose from deep inside him, against his will.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Will you write?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What for?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course, what for?” Erdosain repeated, closing his eyes. Now more than ever he felt he was at the bottom of a pit deeper than anyone could imagine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, señor Erdosain,” the Captain said, standing up, “we’ll be going now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, you’re leaving … you’re leaving already?” Elsa held out a gloved hand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re leaving?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … I’m going … you must see that …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … I see.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was impossible, Remo.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course, impossible … of course …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Captain circled the table and picked up Elsa’s suitcase, the very same one she had brought here on her wedding day. “Goodbye, señor Erdosain.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“At your service, Captain … but just one thing … you’re leaving … you, Elsa, you’re leaving me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, we’re going.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If you don’t mind, I must sit down. Give me a moment, Captain, just a moment.” The interloper bit back an impatient retort. He felt a brutal urge to bark at the husband: “Stand to attention, you idiot!” but restrained himself for Elsa’s sake.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly Erdosain rose from the chair. He walked slowly over to a corner of the room. Then he whirled round to face the Captain and said very clearly, in a voice which betrayed his repressed desire to keep from screaming:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you any idea why I don’t shoot you down like a dog?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two of them stared at each other in alarm.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s because I can’t do it in cold blood.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By now Erdosain was pacing the room, hands clasped behind his back. They watched him and waited.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Finally the husband, with a faint lopsided grin, went on in the same soft voice as before, trailing off as if forcing himself not to burst into tears: “Yes, I was too cold … I am too cold.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He gazed around him unseeing, but with the same strange, hallucinated smile on his lips. “Listen to me … you might not understand any of this, but I’ve found the explanation.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His eyes glittered fiercely, and his voice was hoarse from the effort of getting the words out. “You see … I’ve been so abused in my life … so damaged.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He fell silent, hunched in a corner of the room. On his face he still had the strange smile of a man living a perilous dream. In a fit of annoyance, Elsa was chewing the tip of her handkerchief. The Captain was standing on guard.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly, Erdosain took the revolver from his pocket and flung it into the far corner. The Browning sent flakes of whitewash flying from the wall, then crashed to the floor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Useless piece of rubbish!” he muttered. Then, with one hand in his jacket pocket and pressing his forehead against the wall, he went on slowly: “Yes … I’ve been so abused … humiliated. Believe me, Captain. Don’t be in such a rush to leave. I’ll tell you the story. It was my father who began the twisted task of humiliating me. When I was ten and had done something wrong, he would say to me: ‘tomorrow I’m going to thrash you’. That’s what he always said: ‘tomorrow’. What d’you think of that? Tomorrow … so that night I would sleep awfully, like a sick dog, waking at midnight and staring fearfully at the window to see if it was already day, but when I saw the moon clipping the transom I would force my eyes shut, and tell myself: ‘there’s a long time to go yet.’ Then when the cocks started crowing, I would wake up again. The moon had disappeared, but the panes let in a blue glow, so I would pull the covers over my head so as not to see it, even though I knew it was there … even though I knew no force on earth could get rid of it. Then after I had finally managed to get back to sleep, I would feel a hand on the pillow shaking me. It was my father, who would growl: ‘Come on … it’s time.’ And while I slowly got dressed, I could hear him placing the chair out in the yard. By the time I got there, he would be standing stiffly behind it, like a soldier. ‘Get a move on,’ he shouted at me again, and like a zombie I’d head straight for him; I wanted to say something, but his ferocious glare made it impossible. He would push me down on to my knees until my chest was flat against the seat of the chair, with my head caught between his knees. Then he began to whip me savagely. As soon as he let me go, I’d run to my room in tears. A tremendous sense of shame drove my soul down into the darkness. Because that darkness exists, whether you believe in it or not.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa was staring at her husband in amazement. The Captain stood with his arms folded, aloof. Erdosain was still smiling inanely. He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I knew that most of the kids at school did not get beaten by their fathers. Whenever they mentioned their homes I found myself paralysed by such a dreadful anxiety that if we were in class and the teacher asked me a question, I would stare at him so stupidly, without the faintest idea of what he had said, that one day he bawled at me: ‘What’s the matter with you, Erdosain? Are you an idiot or something?’ The whole class burst out laughing, and from that day on they all called me ‘Erdosain the idiot’. So, still further crushed, still more abused, I kept silent for fear of provoking another beating from my father, and simply smiled at all those who were insulting me … a feeble smile. Can you imagine, Captain? You’re being insulted, and you respond with a feeble smile, as if they were doing you a favour.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The intruder frowned. “Later on … if you’ll excuse me, Captain … later on I was often called ‘the idiot’. Whenever that happened, I could suddenly feel inside me that my soul was shrivelling up, and the feeling that my own soul was slinking away to hide within my flesh destroyed any courage I might have left. I felt I was sinking further and further, but while I searched in the eyes of the person insulting me, instead of knocking him down with a blow, I was thinking: ‘does this person realise just how much he is humiliating me?’ At that, I would crawl away, because I understood that these people were only completing something my father had begun.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So now,” the Captain interjected, “it’s me who’s pushing you down?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, it’s not you. Of course by now I’ve suffered so much that any courage I have left is hidden away deep inside me. I look at myself and ask: ‘Just when will my courage burst out?’ That’s what I’m waiting for. One day something monstrous will explode in me, and I’ll be a different man. And then, if you’re still alive, I’ll come in search of you, and I’ll spit in your face.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The interloper measured him calmly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But it won’t be from hatred, simply to test out my courage, which will seem like a brand-new creation to me … And now you may go.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The interloper hesitated a moment. Erdosain was staring at him with huge wild eyes. The Captain picked up the suitcase and left the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa paused nervously in front of her husband.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, I’m going, Remo … it had to end this way.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But … you … you …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What would you have me do?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then? Don’t get upset, please. I’ve left you your clean clothes. You need to change your collar. You always embarrass me that way.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But you, Elsa … you? What about our plans?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Illusions, Remo … splendid mirages.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, splendid mirages … but where did you learn such a fine phrase? Splendid mirages.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So our life together is finished for ever?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What do you expect? And yet at the start, I was kind to you. It was only later I began to hate you … but why weren’t you the same?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah yes … the same … the same.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suffering weighed down on him like a day of great heat in the tropics. His eyelids felt heavy. All he wanted to do was sleep. The meaning of words sank into his brain as slowly as a stone thrown into a thick swamp. And when the word reached the bottom of his soul, obscure powers stirred up his anguish even more. For a moment, quivering green strands of suffering floated deep inside his chest. Elsa went on, her voice softened by inner resignation:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s no use now … I’m leaving. Why couldn’t you have been kind to me? Why did you never try?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In that instant Erdosain was convinced she was as unhappy as he was, and the immense weight of the discovery crushed him on the edge of his seat next to the table, his head buried in the crook of his arm.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’re leaving? You’re really leaving?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I want to see if our lives can be better this way. Take a look at my hands.” As she said this, she took off her right glove and showed him her hand, chapped from the cold, scarred by bleach, pricked by her sewing needle, blackened by her sooty pots and pans.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stood bolt upright, transfixed by another hallucination.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He could picture his unhappy wife amid the monstrous turmoil of cement and iron cities, darting down dark streets in the slanting shadows of skyscrapers, beneath menacing lines of high-tension cables, lost among crowds of businessmen dry under their umbrellas. Her tiny face was paler than ever, but even as the stale breath from strangers stung her cheeks, she remembered him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where can my little boy be?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain interrupted his vision of the future: “Elsa … you already know … come whenever you want … you can come … but tell me truthfully, did you ever love me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Her eyelids fluttered up, her eyes opened wider. Her voice filled the room with human warmth. Erdosain felt he was coming back to life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve always loved you … I love you now … never &mdash; why did you never talk to me before like you did tonight? I feel I’ll love you always … next to you, he is nothing more than the shadow of a man …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My poor soul … what a life we lead … what a life …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The hint of a smile painfully twisted Elsa’s lips. She stared at him with longing for a moment. Then she said in a grave, pleading tone:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look … promise you’ll wait for me. If life is the way you’ve always said it is, I’ll be back. And then, if you like, we can end it all together … does that make you happy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt the blood rushing to his temples.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My soul, how good you are to me … give me your hand,” and while she was struggling to overcome her fright with a timid smile, he began to kiss it. “You’re not angry are you, my love?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa straightened up, solemnly joyful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look, Remo … I’ll be back, I promise you. And if what you say about life is true … yes, I’ll come, I promise.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re sure?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, with whatever I possess.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Even if you’re rich?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Even if I have all the earth’s millions, I’ll come back. I swear it!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My poor soul! And you do have a noble soul! And yet you could not see who I was … but that doesn’t matter … what a life we’ve led!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Our life … it’s true, what a life! But it doesn’t matter now. I’m so happy. Can you picture how surprised you’ll be, Remo? You’re alone one night … all alone … when suddenly … creak … the door opens … and it’s me … I’ve come back!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you’re wearing a ball gown … white shoes and a pearl necklace.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I came alone on foot through the dark streets, searching for you … but you don’t see me, you’re all on your own … your head …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Go on, tell me … talk, talk …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Your head is in your hands, your elbow propped on the table … you look at me … and all of a sudden …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I recognise you and say: ‘Elsa, is that you?’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And I reply: ‘Yes, Remo, I came back &mdash; d’you remember that night? That night is tonight, and even though the storm is howling outside, we don’t feel any cold or fear. Are you happy, Remo?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I’m happy, I swear to you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, I have to go now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re going?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The man’s face fell in sudden anguish.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’d better leave then.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll be back soon, my husband.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What was that you said?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m saying this to you, Remo: wait for me. Even if I have all the world’s millions, I’ll be back.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Goodbye then … but give me a kiss.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, when I come back … goodbye, my husband.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly Erdosain, overcome by an indescribable impulse, seized her roughly by her wrists.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me this: have you slept with him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Let go of me, Remo … I didn’t think that you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Admit it: did you sleep with him or not?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Captain stood in the doorway. Erdosain sensed a vast weariness loosening the grip of his fingers. He felt he was falling, then saw nothing more.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-56" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-13" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897201878336" class="calibre10"></a>
     LAYERS OF DARKNESS <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">He never knew how he managed to drag himself to his bed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Time ceased to exist for Erdosain. He closed his eyes, obeying the need for sleep his aching insides were crying out for. If he had had the strength, he would have flung himself down a well. Great bubbles of despair frothed in his throat, choking the air from him, while his eyes became more sensitive to the darkness than a wound to salt. Occasionally he had to clench his teeth to stifle the jangling of his nerves, strung taught as wire in his soft, sponge-like flesh that yielded to the waves of darkness emanating from his brain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He squeezed his eyes shut as he felt himself falling down a bottomless hole. He dropped further and further &mdash; who could say how many leagues his body was stretched to in invisible length, only to find itself still incapable of reaching his plunging consciousness as it vanished into a pit of despair! Ever denser layers of darkness fell from his lids.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His pain-ridden core struggled in vain. There was not a single chink in his soul for it to escape through. Erdosain carried all the world’s suffering inside him, all the grief of denying the world. Where on earth could there possibly be anyone whose skin was so gouged with bitterness? He felt he was no longer a man, but a raw wound that writhed and screamed with every throb of his veins. And yet, he was alive. Alive at a distance yet at the same time horrifically close to his own body. He was no longer an organism encompassing its suffering, but something far more inhuman … a monster-like creature curled up on itself in the black belly of the room. Each layer of darkness pouring from his eyelids was like placenta cutting him off further and further from the world of men. The rows of bricks in the walls grew higher and higher, while fresh outpourings of darkness crashed down into the hole where he lay curled up and throbbing, like a shell in the ocean depths. He did not know himself … he could not believe he was Augusto Remo Erdosain. He grasped his forehead in his fingers, but could recognise neither the flesh of his hands nor that of his brow, as though his body were made of two completely different substances. Who can say what had already died in him? All that remained of his feelings was an awareness which existed outside all that was happening to him, a soul as keenly thin as a swordblade, which slithered like an eel through the murky waters of his life. This consciousness took up no more than a square centimetre of his being. The rest dissolved in the darkness &mdash; he was a square centimetre of a man, a square centimetre of existence whose pulsating surface somehow kept this inchoate ghost alive. Everything else in him had died, had been absorbed into the placenta of darkness that insulated him inside this ghastly reality.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He became more and more convinced that he was at the bottom of a concrete block. It was like nothing on this earth! An invisible orange sun in a storm-black sky beat endlessly on its walls. The wing of a solitary bird slashed across the blue sky above, but he was condemned to remain for ever at the bottom of this sullen pit, lit by a storm-orange sun.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The contours of his life were reduced to that square centimetre of feeling. He could even “see” his heartbeat, and it was useless for him to try to spurn this grotesque figure weighing him down on the floor of the abyss, black and orange by turns. If he dropped his guard just a fraction, the reality inside him rose howling round his ears. Erdosain wanted but did not want to look … it was useless … there his wife was, at the far side of a blue-lined room. The Captain was busy in a corner. Erdosain knew, without anyone telling him, that this was a tiny hexagonal-shaped bedroom, almost completely filled by a wide, low bed. He did not want to look at Elsa … no, he did not want to, and yet if he faced death for it, he could not have taken his eyes off the man undressing in front of her … in front of his lawful wife, who was no longer with him but with someone else. Even more powerful than his fear was his need for more terror, more suffering, and then all at once Elsa, who until now had been hiding her face behind her hands, ran over to the naked man with his sturdy legs, his blotched purple manhood erect against the blue background.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt himself crushed by a sense of pure dread. His life could not have been flatter if he had gone through the rollers of a sheet-metal mill. Wasn’t that how toads looked when flattened by a cartwheel on some country track, all squashed and frothing? But he did not want to look, he refused to look with such determination that he managed to see only a blurred outline of how Elsa was leaning against the man’s hairy, bulging chest, while his hands sought out her chin to lift her face to his mouth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then suddenly Elsa cried out: “Me too, my darling, me too.” Her face was red with longing, her clothes a whirling mass over her milk-white thighs, her eyes staring wildly at the trembling man’s rigid muscle, as she revealed the unruly curls of her sex, her straining breasts … Ah! … why did he have to look?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was useless … Elsa … yes, Elsa, his lawfully wedded wife, was trying to caress the whole of the man’s sex with her tiny hand. Groaning with desire, the man clutched his head, covered his face with his forearm, but she leant forward to brand his ears with this burning iron: “You’re more beautiful than my husband! My God, how beautiful you are!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could not have suffered more if someone had twisted his head round on his neck to screw this ghastly vision deep into his soul. He was suffering so much that if there had been any letup in his pain, he would have exploded like shrapnel. How can the soul stand so much pain? And yet he wanted to suffer more. Even if they had put him on a chopping block and sliced him into pieces … even if they had taken the four quarters of his carcass and thrown them into the garbage, he would have gone on suffering. There was not a single square centimetre of his body that was free of this crushing pressure of dread.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All his nerve-strings had snapped as the horrific tension wrenched him apart: until all at once a sudden feeling of calm began to spread through his limbs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He wanted nothing any more. His life was pouring out silently like a lake after its dam has burst. As he lay there, eyes closed but not asleep, this lucid dissolution was a more effective anaesthetic for his pain than any chloroform-induced sleep.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His heart was pumping strongly. He shifted his head laboriously to lift his scalp from the overheated pillow, and let himself go, without any other sense of being alive than the coolness on the back of his neck and the opening and closing of his heart which, like an immense eye, opened its sleepy lid to acknowledge the darkness, and nothing more. Nothing more than darkness?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa had shrunk so far from his memory that during this hypnotic state he could hardly believe he had ever known her. He doubted whether she even existed. Where before he could see her image so clearly, now he had to struggle to recognise her at all. Now his life was pouring silently out &mdash; he contemplated the years speeding backwards, until he was a boy staring at a green tree which shaded the rushing flow of a river full of red-striped pebbles. He himself was a waterfall of flesh in the shadows. Who could say when the draining of his blood would end! The only thing he could feel was the closing and opening of his heart, which like an immense eye lifted its sleepy lid to acknowledge the darkness. A slash of silver from the streetlamp halfway down the street filtered through a chink and fell on the gauze of the mosquito net. Slowly, painfully, he regained a sense of who he was.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was Erdosain. Now he knew once again who he was. With a huge effort, he sat upright. He could make out a yellow line under the dining-room door. He had forgotten to switch the light off. He owed … Ah! no, no … Elsa has left him … he owes 600 pesos and seven cents to the Sugar Company … but no, he doesn’t owe them any more, he’s got a cheque …</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Oh, reality, reality!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The tilted oblong of light from the street which had turned the mosquito net to silver had led him to think he was living as he had before, like the day before, like ten years earlier.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He did not want to see that sliver of light, just as when he had been a boy he had not wanted to be aware of the blue light shining in through the windows, even though he knew it was there, even though he knew there was no force on earth that could extinguish that light. Yes, just like when his father used to tell him that he was going to thrash him “tomorrow”. No, it could not be the same this time. In his childhood, the light had been blue, and now it was silver, although it was equally piercing, just as much a herald of the real world as the earlier one had been. His forehead, the fringe of hair round his temples were soaked with sweat. So Elsa had left, and would never be back? What was Barsut going to say?</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-57" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897201856800" class="calibre10"></a>
     THE SLAP <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Just then, someone came to a halt outside the street door. Erdosain realised it was Barsut, and leapt from his bed. As usual, Barsut began to knock softly as if doing his best to make no noise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain growled at him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Come on in; what’s the matter with you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut came through the door, rocking back on his heels.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m on my way,” Erdosain shouted as the other man entered the dining-room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By the time he emerged from the bedroom, Barsut was already seated, legs crossed; as ever, he had his back to the door and was staring at the south-east corner of the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How’s things?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How’s it going?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut had propped his elbow on the edge of the table, and sat with his chin in his white hand, which took on a coppery glow in the dim electric light. A questioning look softened the harsh glassy stare of his green eyes beneath eyebrows that seemed to stretch all the way back to his ears.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt he was seeing Barsut’s features through a mist of twinkling lights: the forehead sloping back towards pointed ears, the bony bird of prey nose, the lantern jaw capable of taking the hardest blows, the neat knot of his tie plumping out of its starched collar.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In a strained voice, Barsut asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And Elsa?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain pulled himself together.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She’s gone out.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two men fell silent. Erdosain stared fascinated at the right angle Barsut’s grey sleeve made with the white table edge, and the way the lamp lit his cheek with a coppery glow as far as the ridge of the nose, leaving the entire other half, from the roots of his hair to the cleft of his chin, in a darkness that the pool of shadow under his eye only made deeper. Barsut was shifting his legs uncomfortably.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah!” Erdosain heard, and asked: “What did you say?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The fact was it was only now that Erdosain heard the “ah” the other man had uttered seconds earlier. “So Elsa’s gone out?” As he said this, Barsut looked up, and his eyebrows lifted to let more light into his eyes. He hissed through half-open lips:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She’s gone?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain frowned, cast a sideways glance down at the other man’s shoes, then knotted his brows, as if to judge Barsut’s discomfort through a screen, then slowly let fall:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … she’s … gone off … with … a … man …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At that, he winked his left eye just as Ergueta the pharmacist was in the habit of doing. Beneath the bronze line of his brows, his pupils glittered fiercely. Erdosain added: “See? There’s the revolver. I could have killed them both, but I didn’t. What a strange animal man is, isn’t he?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you allowed him to steal your woman from under your nose?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All Erdosain’s pent-up hatred, added to the humiliation he had just received, were suddenly transformed into a kind of malicious glee. His mouth dry with bitterness, he retorted in a quavering voice:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that to you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A tremendous slap rocked him back on his chair. Later he was to recall that Barsut’s arm swung back and forth slapping him like dough. Erdosain covered his face in both hands as he desperately tried to escape from this crunching mass that bore down on him like an unleashed force of nature. His head thumped against the wall, and he fell to the floor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he came round, Barsut was kneeling beside him. He noted that his collar was loose and that streams of water were trickling down his neck. He could feel a stabbing pain from the bridge of his nose, and felt as if he was constantly about to sneeze. His gums were oozing blood, and under his puffy lips his teeth felt jagged on his tongue.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain struggled to his feet, then collapsed on to a chair; Barsut was so pale it seemed his eyes were like two jets of flame. Bands of muscles quivered beneath the skin of his cheeks. Erdosain felt as though he was being tossed in an endless nightmare, but he was aware of Barsut gripping him by the arm and saying:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look, you can spit in my face if you like, but let me speak. I have to tell you everything. Sit properly … that’s it” &mdash; Erdosain had straightened up without realising it &mdash; “Listen to me. I beg you. You’ve seen, haven’t you, that I could kill you with my bare hands … I went too far just now … I swear … if you like, I’ll beg for your forgiveness on bended knee. I can’t help it, that’s the way I am. Look … ah … ah … if people only knew.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain spat blood. A red-hot stab of pain shot through his head. He doubled forward so far his forehead was resting on the table edge. Worried, Barsut asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you want to wash your face? It’ll do you good. Wait a second, don’t move.” At that, he rushed out into the kitchen, and came back with a basin full of water. “Here, rinse your face. You’ll feel better. D’you want me to rub you? I’m sorry, it was instinctive. But why did you wink like that as though you were making fun of me? Wash your face, please.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Without a word, Erdosain plunged his face several times into the basin. Each time, he kept his head down until he ran out of air. Then he sat back and could feel the water evaporating from his wet hair. How tired he was! If only Elsa could see him now! How sorry she would feel for him! He shut his eyes tight. Barsut drew his chair up next to him and insisted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have to tell you everything. If I didn’t I’d feel like a coward. As you can see, I’m quite calm. If you don’t believe me, you can feel my pulse. I’m being frank with you. Well, I … it was me who … it was me who gave you away to the Sugar Company … I sent the anonymous letter.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain did not even lift his head. Barsut or someone else: what was the difference?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut stared at him, waiting for him to speak. Then he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why don’t you say anything? Yes, it was me who betrayed you. D’you understand? I betrayed you. I wanted you to be arrested, so that Elsa would be left with me, so that I could humiliate her. You can’t imagine how many nights I’ve dreamt of them arresting you! You had no way of repaying the money, so they were bound to hand you over to the police. Why don’t you say anything?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain raised his eyes. Barsut was there, it was definitely him, and he was saying all these things. Under the skin of his cheek, the muscles were trembling imperceptibly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut looked down, planted his elbows on his knees as if he were by a fireside, and then went on with slow insistence:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have to tell you everything. Who else could I tell all these things that are tearing me apart? They say, and it’s true, that the heart doesn’t really feel pain, but believe me, there are times when I ask myself: what am I living for? What’s the point of living if this is the way I am? D’you understand? You can’t imagine how often I’ve gone over and over these things in my mind. I shouldn’t even be telling you this. How is it that you can betray someone, then seek that same person out to tell your darkest secrets to, without feeling the slightest remorse? Time and again I’ve asked myself: why don’t you feel any remorse? What kind of life is this if we can be so cruel and not feel a thing? Can you tell me? According to what they taught us at school, sooner or later a crime eventually drives the criminal mad; so how can it be that you commit a crime and are not affected in the slightest?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was staring so hard at Barsut, it seemed his image was imprinted on his consciousness. His life forces wove the pale outline from such a finely meshed net that the impression it captured at that moment would stay with him for ever.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look,” Barsut continued, “I knew you hated me, and that you would have killed me if you could &mdash; and that made me feel happy and sad at the same time. How many nights I’ve gone to bed scheming about the best way to kidnap you! I even thought of sending you a bomb in the mail, or a snake in a cardboard box. Or of paying a driver to run you down in the street. I would shut my eyes and hours would go by while I thought of you two. I suppose you think I was in love with her?” Erdosain later observed that during their conversation that night, Barsut constantly avoided mentioning Elsa by name. “No, I’ve never been in love with her. But I would have loved to humiliate her. Humiliate her just for the sake of it: to see you down and out so that she would be forced to go on her knees and beg me for help. D’you understand? I’ve never loved her. That was why I gave you away like that: to humiliate her, because she was always so high and mighty with me. When you told me you had been swindling the Sugar Company, I felt a raging kind of satisfaction deep inside me. And even before you had finished speaking, I was saying to myself: Now we’ll see just how proud she can be.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could not prevent himself asking:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But did you love her?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I’ve never loved her. If you only knew all she has made me suffer! Love her, when she never so much as gave me her hand? Every time she looked at me, it was as if she were spitting in my face. You may have been her husband, but you never really knew her! What d’you know about the kind of woman she is? She could watch you die and not move a muscle in sympathy. D’you understand? I remember when the Astraldi place went bust and you were out on the street: if she had so much as asked me for everything I had, I would have gladly given it her. Would have given her my whole fortune just to hear her say ‘thank you’. That and nothing more. I would have left myself penniless just to hear those words. Then one day when I tried to talk about it, all she said was: ‘Remo is man enough to earn for both of us.’ Ah, you’ve no idea what she’s like! She’d be capable of watching you die without moving a muscle. And then I’d start thinking &mdash; my God, how many things pass through a man’s mind! I would fling myself down on my bed and start to imagine such crazy things … you had murdered someone … you had to be saved, so she came to beg for my help, and without saying a word of all my sacrifices, I would move heaven and earth for you. What a woman, Remo! I remember when she used to do her sewing. I would have gladly sat beside her just to hold her basket &mdash; and I knew she wasn’t happy with you. I could see it in her face, in her tiredness, in her smile.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The words Elsa had spoken scarcely an hour earlier floated into Erdosain’s mind: “It doesn’t matter … I’m happy. Can you picture how surprised you’ll be, Remo? You’re alone one night … all alone … when suddenly … creak … the door opens … and it’s me … it’s me, I’ve come back.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut went on: “And of course I kept asking myself what made her put up with the life she led with you, alongside a man like you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I came alone on foot through the dark streets, searching for you, but you don’t see me, you’re all alone, your head …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt as if all these thoughts were swirling around the top of his brain like a whirlpool. The huge vortex drilled down into the roots of his being. As it whirled giddily round, it drew a fresh, painful tenderness from his soul. How comforting Elsa’s words had been, how extraordinary!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve always loved you. I love you now … never &mdash; why did you never talk to me before like you did tonight? I feel I’ll love you always, that next to you he is nothing more than the shadow of a man.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt sure these words would save his soul, although Barsut continued to pour out his jealous spite:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“More than anything, I wanted to ask her what she saw in you &mdash; to dissect you in front of her eyes and show her until she was sick of it that you were no more than a madman, a swine, a coward … I swear there’s no anger in me as I tell you all this.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And I believe you,” Erdosain replied.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Right now, looking at you, I ask myself: what does a woman see in a man? That’s something we’ll never know, don’t you agree? To me, you’re nothing more than a poor wretch, someone you can knock out of the way with a blow. But what exactly are you to her? That’s what’s so hard to fathom. D’you think you ever knew? Tell me honestly: did you ever know in your heart what you meant to your wife? What did she see in you to withstand so much at your side, to put up with you the way she did?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">How solemn Barsut was! His hoarse questions demanded an answer. Sitting so close to him, Erdosain felt him not as another man, but as his double, a phantom with a bony nose and bronze-coloured hair who had suddenly become part of his own consciousness, because Barsut was posing him precisely the same questions as it had done in the past. It dawned on him with a cold certainty: for him to live in peace, he would have to get rid of Barsut.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Like plunging a sword into a bale of cotton,” Erdosain later remarked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut had not the faintest idea that at that very moment Erdosain had condemned him to death. When Erdosain was explaining to me how the idea came to him, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you ever seen a general on the field of battle? … But to explain it more clearly, I’ll speak as an inventor: for a long time, you search for the solution to a problem. You know for certain that the answer, the secret, is somewhere within you, but you can’t get at it because it’s hidden beneath so many layers of uncertainty. Then one day, when you least expect it, the plan, the complete vision of the machine, suddenly appears before your eyes, and you’re dazzled by its simple perfection. It’s a miracle! Imagine a general on the battlefield … everything seems lost, but then suddenly he discovers a perfect, simple solution, one he would never have imagined he knew, but which had been there all the time, within his grasp, deep within himself. At that instant I knew I needed to have Barsut killed. Opposite me, he went on pouring out senseless words, oblivious to the fact that, with my puffy mouth and swollen nose, I was having to contain this explosion of joy, this sense of amazement similar to the one you feel when something you discover is as inevitable as a law of mathematics. Perhaps there’s also a mathematics of the spirit, whose terrible laws are merely not as inflexible as those governing the relations between numbers or lines.<sup class="calibre15">1</sup> Here’s the strangest thing. That slap which made my gums bleed was like the stamp of a hydraulic press casting the outlines of a murder plot on to my consciousness. D’you follow me? A plan consists of three main lines, the combination of three straight lines, nothing more. And my excitement stamped out the cold imprint of those three guidelines, which took the following shape: abducting Barsut, having him killed and then using the money to set up the secret society the Astrologer was dreaming of. D’you follow me? The plan for the crime came to me spontaneously, while Barsut was whining on about how both our souls were damned. It was traced as clearly on my mind as if it had been stamped on a metal sheet at thousands of pounds’ pressure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How can I explain it to you? All at once I forgot everything: I was caught up in an icy, joyous contemplation of him, which came over me like the dawn an inveterate night-owl welcomes because it soothes his exhaustion after a wearisome, dissolute night. D’you follow me? Having Barsut killed by someone who needed money urgently to carry out his master plan. And this new dawn stirring inside was so perfectly part of me, I have often wondered since what secrets a man’s soul must contain for it to constantly astound him with fresh vistas of this sort, reveal things to him which are so apparently inexplicable that they leave him stunned.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In my retelling of this episode, I have omitted to mention that when Erdosain got carried away, he would circle around his central “idea” with a torrent of words. In the grip of a slow frenzy which as he spoke gave him the feeling of being extraordinary rather than a useless nobody, he had to exhaust every last possibility of expression. I had no doubt he was telling the truth. What confused me was the question I kept asking myself: where did this man get the strength from to bear the sight of himself like this for so long? It seemed his whole vocation was to look into himself, to analyse what was going on inside him, as if the very accumulation of details could convince him he was really alive. I insist: a dead man blessed with the power of speech could not have said more than Erdosain did, to persuade himself he was not in fact dead.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Without the slightest idea of all that was happening in Erdosain, Barsut went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, you don’t know her … you’ve never known her. For example … listen to what I’m going to tell you. One evening I came to see you, but I knew you weren’t in, it was her I really wanted to see &mdash; nothing more than that. I arrived in a lather, I don’t know how many blocks I’d walked in the sun before I plucked up enough courage.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just like me, in the sun,” thought Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I walked, even though as you know I can well afford a taxi. Then when I asked after you she said, without moving from the doorway:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘I’m sorry, I can’t ask you in because my husband’s not here.’ D’you see what a bitch she is?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain thought:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s still a train to Temperley.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut continued:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“As far as I could tell, you were nothing more than a poor devil, so I kept wondering: what could Elsa have seen in this dimwit for her to fall in love with him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the calmest of voices, Erdosain asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you can see from my face that I’m such an idiot?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut looked up in surprise. For a moment, he kept his flashing green eyes fixed on Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The curtain of light that fell on their two heads created an illusion of great distance. It seemed Barsut realised he was as much a phantom as the other man, because he shook his head with great difficulty, as if his neck muscles had suddenly gone stiff, and replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, now I look at you closely, you seem more like someone with an obsession … God knows what.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain laughed:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re a real psychologist. Of course, I’ve no idea either what the obsession might be … but it’s strange, it never occurred to me you would think of trying to take my wife from me … and how calmly you say these things!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can’t deny I’m being completely frank with you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And anyway, I wanted to humiliate her, not steal her from you. What would have been the point of that? I knew she would never love me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How did you work that out?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what I don’t know. Because people do things they can never explain. Because I kept on seeing you, and you kept on receiving me, even though we couldn’t ‘stand’ each other. I came because that way I made you suffer, and suffered myself. Every day I would tell myself: ‘I’m not going there again … I’m not going there again …’ but as soon as the time arrived, I would get all nervous. It was as though I was being called from somewhere, so I’d get dressed in a hurry … and come over …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden Erdosain had a strange idea:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“While we’re on the subject … I’m not sure if you know, but this morning they discovered the anonymous letter at the Sugar Company. If I can’t pay up by tomorrow, they’ll have me arrested. I think you’ll be the first to admit that the one and only person to blame for all this is you: so it’s you who should give me the money. Where on earth am I to get it otherwise?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut sat bolt upright in astonishment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that? Here I am, cuckolded and beaten like a dog, Elsa’s gone and I’ve done something terrible, and you expect me to come up with the money? Are you crazy? What possible reason could I have for giving you 600 pesos?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And seven cents …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stood up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is that your final word?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You have to understand … how could I …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, ‘kid’ … we’ll have to wait and see. Now do me a favour and get out, I want to go to sleep.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t you feel like going out?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m tired. Leave me now.” Barsut hesitated, then stood up as well, clutching his hat brim in one hand, and stumbled from the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain heard the street door slam, stood there frowning for a few moments, searched in his pocket for a railway guide, looked up the timetable, then went and washed his face again, and finally combed his hair in front of the mirror. His lip was swollen, and there were red weals round his nose and on the side of his head by the hairline.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He looked round in search of something, spotted the revolver on the floor, stooped to pick it up, and went out. Then he realised he had left the light on, so came back in and turned the lamp off. In the darkness the light continued to gleam in his eyes for a brief moment as he went out again. For the second time that day, he was heading for the Astrologer’s house.</div>

     “BEING” THANKS TO A CRIME <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Light shone from the telegraph office door and dimly lit part of the Temperley station platform. Erdosain sat in the darkness on a bench next to the points switches. He was chilled, perhaps with a fever. He felt that the idea of the crime was an extension of his own body, just like the shadow he could cast into the light. A red disc shone at the end of an invisible signal arm: other red and green circles were pinned further off in the darkness, and their reflection fused with the rails as they curved into the night, lending them alternately a bluish or a pink glow. Sometimes the red or green light changed position. Then there was silence, as the chains stopped clanking against their supports, and the wires ceased to hum.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was only half-awake.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What am I doing here? Why am I staying here? Is it true I want to kill him? Or is it because I want to have the will to kill him? Why should that matter? At this very moment, she is rolling around in bed with him. What’s that to me? Before, when she was alone at home and I was in the café, I felt sorry for her, because she was unhappy with me … now it’s different … they’ll be asleep already, she’ll have her head on his chest. Good God! Can this be all there is? To feel lost, all the time lost? But am I really who I am? What if I were someone else? The strange distance! To live so distant from yourself! That’s what I do. Just like him. When he’s not around I can see him for what he is, a poor wretch. He almost broke my nose. How incredible! Now somehow it turns out he’s the one who’s been cuckolded and beaten, and not me! Me! … Really, life is a grotesque joke! Yet there must be more to it than that. Why do I loathe him so much when he’s with me?” Shadows flitted behind the yellow window of the telegraph office.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“To kill him or not to kill him? What does it matter to me? Does it matter if I kill him? Let’s be honest. Is it important to me to kill him? Or is it all the same to me? Is it all the same if he lives? Yet I want to have the will to kill him. If a god appeared before me now and asked: ‘Do you want to have the power to destroy the whole of humanity?’ would I do it? Would I destroy it? No, I wouldn’t. Simply knowing I had the power to do so would rob the idea of all interest. Anyway, what would I do all alone on earth? Watch dynamos in workshops grow rusty, or the skeletons perched astride the furnaces crumble into dust? It’s true he slapped me around, but do I care? What a list! What a collection! The Captain, Elsa, Barsut, the Man with the Hogshead, the Astrologer, the Thug, Ergueta. What a list! Where can all these monsters have sprung from? I’m not at the centre of my being either, I am not who I am, and yet I need to do something to prove my existence, to affirm it. That’s it, affirm it. Because it’s as if I were dead. For the Captain, for Elsa, for Barsut I simply don’t exist. If they like, they can have me arrested, Barsut can slap me again, Elsa run off with someone else under my nose, the Captain can steal her from me again. I’m like the negation of life for all of them. Something like non-being. A man is not simply action, therefore he does not exist. Or does he exist in spite of not being? He is and is not. Take a look at men. Probably they have wives, children, houses. Perhaps they’re all losers. But if anyone tries to break into their home, to steal a cent from them, or lays a finger on their wife, they turn into wild animals. So why didn’t I revolt? Who can answer that for me? I certainly can’t. I only know that’s how I exist, as a negation. And when I say this kind of thing I’m not sad: my soul stays silent, my head empty. Then out of that silence and emptiness a curiosity about killing surges up from my heart. Precisely that. I’m not crazy, because I know how to think, to reason. It’s a curiosity that rises in me, a curiosity that must be my ultimate sorrow, the sorrow of curiosity. Or the demon of curiosity. To find out how I am thanks to a crime. That’s exactly it. To find out how my consciousness and my sensibility react to committing a crime.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And yet these words don’t make me feel the crime, just as a cable about a disaster in China doesn’t give me the feeling of that disaster. It’s as if someone else were thinking of the murder, and not me. Someone else who like me would be a man who was all surface, the shadow of a man, like in the cinema. He has a silhouette, he moves about, he seems to exist, to suffer, and yet he is nothing more than a shadow. He has no life. I swear to God, all this makes sense. So, what would this shadow man do? He would be aware of what had happened, but would be unable to feel its weight, because he had no volume to absorb it into. He is only a shadow. And I too see what’s happened, but can’t absorb it. This must be a new theory. I wonder what a criminal court judge would make of it? Would he realise how honest I’m being? Do people like that believe in honesty? Things move around me, beyond the limits of my body, but to them my life must be as inconceivable as living on the earth and the moon at the same time. I’m nothing to anyone. And yet, if tomorrow I throw a bomb or kill Barsut, then I become everything, a man who exists, a man who generations of legal experts have prepared punishments, gaols, and theories for. So I, who am nothing, would set in motion that fearful machinery of experts, secretaries, journalists, lawyers, prosecutors, warders, prison vans. Nobody would see me as a poor devil, but as an antisocial being, the enemy society would have to be protected from. That’s so strange! And yet it is only thanks to crime that I can affirm my existence, just as it is only evil which affirms man’s presence on earth. I would be the Erdosain who was predicted and feared, defined by the penal code; among the thousands of anonymous Erdosains who infect this world, I would be the other, authentic Erdosain, the one who is and always will be. All this is very strange. And yet despite everything, darkness does exist, and man’s soul is full of sorrow. Infinite sorrow. But that cannot be all there is to life. Something inside me tells me life cannot be like that. If I could only discover the precise reason why life cannot be that way, I could stick a pin in myself, and all this hot air of lies would be deflated like a balloon. Out of my present state a brand-new man would emerge, a man as powerful as one of the primeval gods of creation. But all this is getting me away from the point. Shall I go and see the Astrologer or not? What will he say when he sees me back again? Perhaps he’s expecting me. Like me, he’s a mystery to himself. That’s the truth of it. He’s as uncertain as I am about where he’s heading. A secret society! For him, the whole of society is summed up in those words: a secret society! Another devil. What a collection! Barsut, Ergueta, the Thug and me … Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t come up with such an assortment. And to top it all, the pregnant blind girl. What a monster!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The station guard walked past Erdosain a second time. He realised he was arousing the man’s suspicions, so he got up and set off for the Astrologer’s house. It was a moonless night. Streetlamps shone among the leafy branches at the street-corners. The sounds of a piano drifted out from one of the houses, and as he walked on, Erdosain could sense his heart shrivelling still further, oppressed once more by a sense of anguish at this glimpse of happiness behind the walls of houses cooled by the shade, each with its car drawn up outside the garage.</div>

     THE PROPOSAL <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer was about to go to bed when he heard footsteps on the gravel path to the house. Since the dog did not bark, he opened the shutter a little way. In the yellow oblong of light that shone out on to the tops of the pomegranate trees he could see Erdosain coming his way, the light shining directly on his face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s strange!” the Astrologer thought. “I hadn’t noticed until now that the kid wears a straw boater! What can he want?” Then after making sure he had his revolver in his waistband (an instinctive gesture with him) he unlocked the door. Erdosain stepped in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was afraid you were in bed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Come on in.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain went into the study. The map of the United States was still there, with black flags stuck in the regions the Ku-Klux-Klan dominated. The Astrologer must have been working on a horoscope because there was a compass box open on the table. A breeze from the garden stirred the papers, and Erdosain waited while the other man put some of them away in the cabinet, then he sat down with his back to the window.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He sat and stared at the Astrologer’s broad, flat face, his twisted nose plunging down from the tumultuous forehead, the cauliflower ears, the barrel chest stuffed inside the faded black jacket, the copper chain dangling across his waistcoat, the steel ring with its purple stone on a gnarled, weather-beaten hand. Without his hat, the Astrologer’s hair was short, thick and curly. He had stretched out his legs and was leaning the full weight of his body on the arms of the chair. His unpolished boots completed the image he gave of a peasant from the mountains, or a gold prospector. “Surely this is what prospectors in Patagonia look like?” Erdosain thought, gazing absent-mindedly at the map of the United States and going over what he had heard the Astrologer say that afternoon as he pointed out the different states to the Thug.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Ku-Klux-Klan is powerful in Texas, Ohio, Indianapolis, Oklahoma, Oregon …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, my friend … what …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, that’s right! I came to see you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was just about to go to bed. I’ve been working on a horoscope for some idiot …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If I’m disturbing you, I’ll leave.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, stay. Have you been in a fight? What’s the matter?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Lots of things. Tell me, if you could … Don’t be taken aback by my question … but if, to get your secret society started, if to raise the 20,000 pesos you need … if to raise the money you had to kill someone, would you do it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer sat upright in the chair, his body jerked into a right angle by his astonishment … Although the thoughts Erdosain was voicing made him lift his head in surprise, it still seemed to weigh mightily on his shoulders. He rubbed his hands and searched Erdosain’s face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why on earth are you asking me a question like that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve found the guy with the 20,000 pesos. We could kidnap him, and if he refuses to sign the cheque for us, we could torture him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer frowned deeply. He was even more perplexed as he heard the details of the proposal, and began to twist the ring on his right hand. The purple stone reflected time and again in the bronze watch-chain. Although he had his face down, his eyes peered up at Erdosain’s face from beneath the line of his brows. In this position, his misshapen nose seemed like a buttress overhanging the chin sunk into the black cloth of his bow tie.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’ll have to explain it all to me, I haven’t understood a word so far.” He had straightened up again, his face looking as though it could withstand a hail of blows. “It’s simple but brilliant. Tonight, my wife left me to go and live with another man. So he …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who is he …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Barsut, my wife’s cousin … Gregorio Barsut … he came to see me and confessed it was he who betrayed me to the Sugar Company.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah … so he was the one who betrayed you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and to top it all …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What reason did he have?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How should I know! To humiliate me … anyway, he’s pretty crazy. He’s someone who’s out of control. He’s got 20,000 pesos. His father died in an asylum. That’s where he’s going to end up. He inherited the 20,000 from an aunt on his father’s side.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer bowed his head on his hand. He was more lost than ever. The idea intrigued him, but he was not sure he understood. He insisted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me everything, bit by bit.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain began again from the beginning. He told the story as we already know it. He had lost his earlier nervousness at revealing his proposal to the Astrologer, and spoke slowly and carefully.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By now he was bent right forward on the edge of his seat, elbows on knees, his hands cupping his cheeks as he stared down at the floor. The yellow skin stretched taut across his wide cheekbones made him look like a consumptive. A stream of depravity poured endlessly from his throat, as though he were flatly reciting a lesson cast on his mind like a die. Covering his mouth with his fingers, the Astrologer sat listening to him dumbfounded. He had imagined many things, but not all this.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain spoke slowly, choosing his words carefully in order not to make any mistake, as he spilled out the list of all his fears, his humiliations, memories, sorrows, all his sleepless nights and bitter quarrels. One of the many things he said was:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It might seem crazy to you that although I came here to propose we kill someone, I see myself as innocent &mdash; but I’m talking about when I was twenty and still very much a kid. Have you any idea what kind of sadness it is that leads a person to spend their nights in some ghastly bar, whiling away the time in futile conversations and drinking cheap rum? Do you know what it’s like to be in a brothel when all of a sudden you find it impossible to control yourself and not break down in tears? You’re staring at me in amazement &mdash; perhaps you thought of me as a bit odd, but you had no idea that all the strangeness was born of the anguish I carry deep inside. I’m even amazed at the precision I can describe all this with. Who am I? Where am I headed? I’ve no idea. And yet I sense you are just like me, and that’s why I came here to suggest we kill Barsut. We can use the money to set up the secret group, and that way we’ll rock the foundations of this society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer butted in:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why have you always been like this?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what I don’t know. Why do you want to set up your organisation? Why does the Melancholy Thug go on exploiting women and polishing his own boots when he already has a fortune? Why did Ergueta ditch the million-airess and marry a whore? Do you think I put up with the slap Barsut gave me, or what the Captain did, just like that? On the face of it, I am a coward, Ergueta is a madman, the Thug a miser, you a man obsessed. On the face of it, that’s what we are, but deep down inside, somewhere beneath our own awareness and conscious thoughts, there’s another life that’s far more powerful and vaster … so that if we put up with everything it’s because we believe that by hanging on, by doing so we’ll finally get at the truth … I mean, the truth about ourselves.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer got to his feet, walked over to Erdosain and patted him on the head. He said, uncertainly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re quite right, my boy. We’re mystics without knowing it. The Melancholy Thug is a mystic, Ergueta is a mystic, so are you, me, her, and all of them … the lack of religion that is this century’s evil has so destroyed our understanding that we look outside ourselves for what in fact exists within the mystery of our own subconsciousness. We need a religion to save us from the catastrophe that has befallen us. You might object that what I’m saying is nothing new. Fine, but just remember that on this earth all that changes is the style, the way things are done; the substance stays the same. If you believed in God you would have been spared your wretched life; if I believed in God I wouldn’t be listening to you now proposing to kill a fellow man. And the worst of all is that for us the time to discover a belief, a faith, has already passed. If we went to see a priest, he wouldn’t understand our problems. All he could do would be to recommend we recite the Lord’s Prayer and go to mass every week.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And all the time we ask ourselves what is to be done …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right. What is to be done … In days gone by we would at least have had the chance to take refuge in a convent or to go on a journey to distant, magical lands. Nowadays you can eat an ice cream in Patagonia in the morning and bananas in Brazil in the afternoon. What is to be done? I read a lot, and believe me, all the books from Europe are full of the same current of bitterness and despair you speak of in your own life. Just look at the United States. Movie stars have platinum ovary implants; and there are murderers trying to beat the record for the most horrible crime. You’ve been around, you’ve seen it. House after house, different faces but the same hearts. Humanity has lost its ability to celebrate, to feel joy. Mankind is so unhappy it’s even lost God! Even a 300-horsepower engine is only fun when driven by a madman who is likely to smash himself to pieces in a ditch. Man is a sad animal who only rejoices in wonders. Or massacres. Well, in our society we’ll make sure we give them wonders &mdash; plagues of Asiatic cholera, myths, the discovery of gold deposits or diamond mines. I’ve seen it when we two talk. You only come alive when some fresh wonder is mentioned. It’s the same with everyone, criminal or saint.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, are we going to kidnap Barsut?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes. Now we have to work out exactly how we’ll get hold of him and his money.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The wind stirred the leaves in the garden. Erdosain sat for a few moments looking at the shaft of light which shone from the half-open window on to the pomegranate trees. The Astrologer had scraped back his chair, and now lolled with his head against the dark brown cabinet top. He was once again twisting the steel ring on his finger, up in front of his face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How will we get hold of him? That’s easy. I’ll tell Barsut I’ve found out where the Captain has taken Elsa …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s a good idea. But how have you found out &mdash; that’s what he’s bound to ask …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll tell him I went to the Personnel Department at the War Ministry.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Perfect … that’s very good … fine …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer had leaned forward enthusiastically, and was watching Erdosain with interest.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And with the excuse that we want him to convince Elsa to come back to me, we’ll bring him here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Excellent. Let me think it through. Everything you’ve suggested … seems to fit. Ah … tell me one thing: does he have any family?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Not except for my wife.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where does he live?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In a rented room. The owner’s daughter is cross-eyed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What will they say when Barsut vanishes?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Here’s what we can do. We send his landlady a telegram from Rosario signed by him, asking her to send his things to a certain hotel, where you’ll be staying under his name.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Perfect! You’ve thought it all out very well. The plan’s perfect. It’s true that everything’s in our favour: the Captain, the address from the ministry, the fact he has no relatives, that he lives in lodgings. It’s as clear-cut as a chess move. Perfect!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">After he had finished talking, the Astrologer began to pace up and down the room. Each time he passed in front of the window, he blocked the light to the garden, or cast a huge shadow across the cabinet and up to the roofbeams. Erdosain was right to say that the plan was as sharply defined as if “it had been stamped at thousands of pounds’ pressure”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer’s boots thumped loudly with each step, and Erdosain was already beginning to regret that the “plan” was so simple, so devoid of any literary twists and turns. He would have liked to add some extra perilous adventure, to make it less geometrically perfect.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Damn it: this is no fun! This way, anyone can be a murderer!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And is there nothing between Gregorio and the cross-eyed girl?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why did you mention her then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re not afraid you’ll be remorse-stricken after ‘it’ happens?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I think that only happens in novels. In real life I’ve done both good and bad, and in neither case have I felt the slightest joy or the least sense of remorse. I reckon that what’s called remorse is simply fear of punishment. In Argentina they don’t hang people, and only cowards …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about you …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Excuse me, but I’m no coward. I am coldblooded, which is different. Just think about it. If I’ve let my wife be taken from me without reacting, if I’ve let myself be slapped around by someone who betrayed me, isn’t it even more likely I’ll watch him die without moving a muscle, provided it’s not a bloodbath?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s true. It’s very logical. Everything you say is logical. D’you know, you’re a really interesting guy, Erdosain?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what my wife used to say. But that didn’t stop her going off with someone else.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you hate him for it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sometimes. It depends. Perhaps with me it’s more of a physical revulsion than hatred. And really, no, I don’t hate him, you can’t hate people you know are capable of exactly the same kind of baseness as you are.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So why do you want to have him killed?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And why do you want to set up your society?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do you think this crime is going to have any effect on your life?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what I’m curious to find out. To find out if my life, my way of seeing things or my sensibility change after watching him die. Anyway, I feel the need to kill someone. Even if only to take me out of myself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you want me to do the dirty work for you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course! … Because for you, ‘doing my dirty work’ means getting the 20,000 pesos you need to set up your organisation and the brothels …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What made you think I was someone who would do ‘that’?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What? I’ve been observing you for a long time. But I became convinced you were the sort of person who would take this kind of risk a year ago, when I met you at the Theosophy Society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How’s that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I remember it as if it were now. A woman who sold coal was on your left, talking about the perispirit with a shoemaker. Have you ever noticed how fascinated shoemakers are by the occult sciences, by the way?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then you started talking to a Polish gentleman who was in contact with Sobiezki’s spirit.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t remember …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I do. The Polish gentleman, as you yourself later told me, was a building labourer … You and the Polish gentleman moved on from talking about Sobiezki to a discussion on ‘the homing instinct of pigeons’, and you told him: ‘the only importance the homing instinct of pigeons has for me is so they could act as go-betweens in a blackmail plot’. Then you began to explain what you meant … and by the time you had finished, to the astonishment of the Polack, the coal-seller and the shoemaker, I was saying to myself: ‘There’s a man ready for anything …’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ha, hal You’re quite a guy, d’you know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sure. Remember: the mechanism of our plot is made up of three smaller parts that all have to mesh together perfectly, though they’re independent of each other. The first part is the kidnapping. The second is your trip to Rosario, where you’ll send for and receive the luggage in Barsut’s name. The third is the murder itself and the disposal of the body.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Will we get rid of it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course. Either with nitric acid or in a big furnace … in which case, we’ll need a heat of at least 500 degrees to make sure the bones are reduced to ash.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How do you know all this?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m an inventor, remember. Ah, and we can use part of the 20,000 pesos to mass-produce my copper roses. At the moment, a family I know is making them for me. One of the boys might be a candidate for your society. And just recently I’ve been thinking of a way to modify Stephenson’s steam engine with electromagnetics. It would make it a hundred times simpler. D’you know what I really need? To get away for a while, to go to the mountains, to get some rest and study.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You could go to the camp we’re organising.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you agree to the plan?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just one thing … where did Barsut get his money?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Three years ago he sold a house he had inherited.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So he has it in a savings account?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, in his current account.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He doesn’t live off the interest?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, he’s spending it bit by bit. Two hundred pesos a month. He says he’ll be dead before he’s got through it all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s strange. What sort of man is he?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Strong. Cruel. You’ll have to plan the abduction very carefully, because he’ll resist like a wild animal.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah … before I go. Are you planning to tell the Thug about any of this?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No. It’s a secret between the two of us. The Thug’s job is simply to organise the brothels, that’s all. You’ll pay back the Sugar Company tomorrow, is that right?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now I come to think of it, I know a counterfeiter. He can draw up the document from the War Ministry.” Erdosain paced up and down the room for a while. “The kidnapping should be easy. You go to Rosario and send a telegram for the trunks. The thing is, when you’re faced with actually committing a crime …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“This won’t be the only one we’ll commit …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course not. Something else I’m concerned about is how we’ll keep things secret in the society. Here’s what I thought: we’ll have revolutionary cells in every corner of Argentina. The central committee will be based here in the capital. It will be made up as follows: each provincial leader will be a member, and each leader of a provincial district will be a member of the provincial capital committee, and each leader of a provincial town will be a member of the provincial capital committee, and so on.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Doesn’t that seem a bit complicated?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know, we’ll work it out. I’ve thought of other organisational details as well: each cell will have a radio receiver and transmitter, and every ten members will commit themselves to buying a vehicle, ten rifles and two machine guns. Every hundred members will be responsible for buying a warplane, bombs, and so on. All promotions will be decided by the central committee, all lesser appointments will be decided by restricted voting. But now it’s time to go to bed. There’s a train in a few minutes … or would you prefer to sleep here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had no real reason to leave. The clock had already struck three, and all the last part of what the Astrologer had said had passed him by in a daze. He could not take any more in. He needed to get away, that was all. To get as far away as possible.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They shook hands; the Astrologer said goodbye at the top of the steps, and Erdosain made his way, exhausted, through the garden. When he turned to look back from the shadows, the lighted window hung like a yellow rectangle in the darkness.</div>

     UP THE TREE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Day is breaking. Erdosain is walking along the track on the broken ground outside the walled gardens. The morning chill penetrates to the remotest cell of his tired lungs. The sky above is still dark, making everything in the distance invisible, and everything else seem closer. At the far end of the labyrinth of streets, a few greenish stripes are lightening the sky.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he walks along, Erdosain is thinking: “This is as sad as a desert. At this hour, she’s asleep with him.”<sup class="calibre15">2</sup></div>
    <div class="paragraph">Wisps of white mist seep into the streets from the watery light of dawn.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain says to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And yet I must be strong. I remember when I was a child. I imagined I saw huge men walking on the crest of clouds, their hair streaming out and their limbs sheathed in light. In fact, they were striding through the land of joy I had within me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, losing a dream is almost as bad as losing a fortune. What am I saying? It’s far worse. You have to be strong, that’s all there is to it. And to have no compassion. And however weary you are, to say to yourself: I may be tired now, I may regret everything now, but things will be different tomorrow. That’s all there is: tomorrow.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain closes his eyes. A perfume of carnations or balsam fills the air with a strange carnival atmosphere.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Erdosain thinks:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In spite of everything, life must be filled with joy. This is no way to live. It’s not right. There must be some kind of joy that rises above all our misery, I don’t know, something nobler than our ugly human face, our appalling human truth. The Astrologer is right. We have to usher in the realm of falsehood, of magnificent lies. To worship someone. Force a way through this forest of stupidity. But how?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain goes on talking to himself as the sun brings a pink blush to his cheeks:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What does it matter if I’m a murderer or a degenerate? Does it? No. It’s a minor problem. There’s something far more important than the baseness of the whole of mankind put together, and that is joy. If I could rejoice, then happiness would absolve me of my crime. Joy is all that matters. That, and loving someone …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The sky turns green in the distance, while the trunks of the trees are still submerged in low-lying darkness. Erdosain frowns. Wisps of memory float free from his mind, golden mists, glittering rails stretching into the distance of an afternoon landscape under a canopy of sun. And the face of a girl, a small, pale face with green speckled eyes and black curls escaping from beneath a straw hat, rises to the surface.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Two years ago. No. Three. Yes, three years earlier. What was her name? Maria, Maria Esther. What was it? Her sweet face warms the night-time world of his fantasy. He remembers so well! He was sitting beside her, the wind was ruffling her black curls, and all at once he stretched out his hand and cupped her chin in his hands. Where can she be now? What roof is she sleeping under? If he saw her, would he recognise her? Three years ago. He met her on a train, talked with her a few minutes for a fortnight or so, then she disappeared. That was all there was to it. And she did not know he was married. What would she have said if she had known? Yes, now he remembers. Her name was Maria. But what does that matter? Not at all. There was something more precious in it all: the gentle warmth that shone from those eyes of hers, now green, now brown. And her silence. Erdosain remembers the train journeys; he is sitting next to the girl; she rests her head on his shoulder, he twists her curls round his fingers, and the girl trembles in silence. If she knew he was planning to kill someone, what would she say? She might not even understand the word. Erdosain remembers how she reached up like a shy schoolgirl to stroke his rough, unshaven cheeks, and just possibly the happiness he has lost is exactly what is needed to wipe all traces of ugliness from the human face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Now Erdosain begins to question himself. Why is he thinking all this? What right does he have? Since when do apprentice murderers think? And yet despite everything, there is something in him which gives thanks to the universe. Could it be humility or love? He does not know, but he perceives there is a sweetness in this very lack of coherence, it seems to him that when a poor soul is driven mad, it is thankful to abandon the sorrows of this earth. And underpinning this feeling of pity, an irresistible, almost ironic force leads him to curl his lip in disdain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The gods exist. They live concealed under the skin of certain people who can remember life on this planet when the earth was still young. Erdosain also has a god within him. Could it be possible? He feels his nose, still throbbing from the beating Barsut has given him, and the irresistible force once again insists: he does have a god concealed beneath his painful skin. Does the penal code provide for the punishment of a murderous god? What would the judge say if he answered him: “I sin because I have a god inside me”?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And yet, isn’t it true? This love, this strength that flows through him in the dawn under the trees dripping dew, is it not proof of his godlike nature? Once more the memory stands out on the surface of his mind: a pale, oval face with green eyes and black curls that the breeze blew across her throat. How simple it all is! He is in such a trance he has no need to say anything. Although he might just as well have gone mad thinking like this about the schoolgirl under the dripping trees. What other reason could there be for his soul being so different from when it kept him in torment the previous night? Or can it be that at night we think only dark thoughts? Even if this is true, it does not matter. He is another man now. He is smiling under the trees. Isn’t it all wonderfully absurd? The Melancholy Thug, the depraved blind girl, Ergueta and his Christ myth, the Astrologer, all those incomprehensible phantoms who speak a human language, who put flesh on words, what are any of them compared to him as he leans on a post by a climbing wistaria, as he feels life surging through his breast?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He is another man, from the simple fact of having thought of the child resting her head on his shoulder in a train compartment. Erdosain closes his eyes. The acrid smell of earth makes him shiver. A feeling of giddiness rises from his weary body.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Someone comes towards him on the path. A raucous whistle reaches him from the station. Other men in caps or lopsided hats pass by in the distance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What on earth is he doing here? Erdosain blinks one eye, aware he is cheating on God, playing out the comedy of someone unable to avoid God’s curse on him. Yet now and again flashes of darkness pass before his eyes, and a kind of dull intoxication takes hold of his senses. He wants to violate something. To violate common sense. If there had been any bundles of hay nearby, he would have set fire to them … his face swells with a repugnant look, takes on the vile expression of madness; suddenly he sees a tree, jumps into the air, grabs on to a branch, clings to it while he scrabbles with his feet on the trunk, gets his elbows over the top, and manages to pull himself up into the fork of the acacia.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His shoes slip on the shiny bark, twigs whip against his face, but he clambers upright holding on to another branch, and peers through the wet leaves. Down below, the road winds among islands of trees.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Now he is up in the tree. He has violated common sense, for the sake of it, for no reason, like someone who kills a passer-by simply because he bumped into him, to see if the police will track him down. Over in the east, gloomy chimneys stand out against the green-streaked sky; beyond them mounds of green fill the lowlying land of Banfield like monstrous herds of elephants; and still he feels desolate. He knows now it is not enough to violate common sense to feel happy. He makes one last effort and shouts out loud:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Hey, you sleeping beasts! Hey! … I swear that … but no … I want to violate the laws of common sense, so stay calm, little animals. No. What I really want to preach is daring, a new life. I am speaking out of a tree, but I’m not ‘up a gum tree’, it’s an acacia: Hey, you sleeping beasts!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His strength quickly drains away. He looks all around as if surprised at finding himself in this position, then all at once the face of the distant girl blooms in his mind like a flower. Suddenly ashamed of the scene he is making,<sup class="calibre15">3</sup> he climbs down from the tree. He is vanquished. A broken man.</div>
    <br class="calibre1" />
    <div class="paragraph">Footnotes</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">1</sup> This chapter in Erdosain’s confessions led me to wonder whether the idea of the crime he was going to commit did not already exist in his subconscious mind, which would serve to explain his passivity in the face of Barsut’s aggression.</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">2</sup> It was only later Erdosain learnt that at that very moment Elsa was being looked after by a sister of charity. A single ill-advised gesture from the Captain had been enough for her to realise the predicament she had got herself into, and she had leapt from the vehicle they were in. She decided to go to a hospital, where she was taken in by the mother superior, who realised she was dealing with a woman at her wits’ end.</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">3</sup> Erdosain offered me two explanations for this state. The first was that he was immensely pleased at pretending to be mad, like someone “who has drunk one glass of wine but pretends to be drunk to his friends, in order to trick them”. Erdosain gave a sad smile while he was explaining all this, and told me that when he climbed down out of the acacia he felt ashamed in the same way as someone who dresses up for Carnival and shows off in front ofa group ofstrangers, but instead of making them laugh, elicits only a contemptuous remark. “I was so sick of myself I even thought of committing suicide, and was sorry I didn’t have my revolver with me. It was only when I was getting undressed back at home that I realised I’d forgotten I had my gun in my trouser pocket.”</div>

     INCOHERENCIES <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain spent the days leading to Barsut’s abduction in a room he rented after paying off the Sugar Company. He had become terrified of going out. He never thought about the planned abduction, and even ceased to visit the Astrologer. Instead, he spent every day in bed, his forehead pressed against his clenched fists on the pillow. Or he would spend hours staring at the wall, up which he imagined he could see wisps of dreams and despair floating.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In all those days he could not even summon up Elsa’s face. “She had vanished so mysteriously from my mind, it took a supreme effort simply to recall any of her features.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Later he would fall asleep or go over everything again in his mind.<sup class="calibre15">1</sup> He tried in vain to concentrate on two projects he considered important: adapting steam engines to electromagnetics, and the idea of setting up a dog salon where people could get their pets dyed electric blue, their bulldogs bright green, purple greyhounds, lilac fox-terriers, lapdogs with three-toned photos of sunsets printed across their backs, little pooches with swirls like a Persian rug. He was in torment: one afternoon he fell asleep and had the following dream:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He knew one of the Spanish princesses was enamoured of him. This plus the fact that he was his Majesty Alfonso XIII’s lackey made him extremely happy, because it meant he was surrounded by generals constantly trying to discover his secrets. The mirror of a lake nibbled at the trunks of trees permanently in the whitest of white bloom, whilst the lissom princess took him by the arm and said in her Spanish lilt:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do you love me, Erdosain?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain burst out laughing and replied with an insult: at this, a circle of swords flashed before his eyes and he felt he was drowning, one catastrophe after another tore the continents asunder, but he did not care because he had been sleeping for centuries in a leaden shack at the bottom of the sea. Outside his window one-eyed sharks circled, furious because they had piles, which made Erdosain laugh with the stifled laugh of someone who does not want to be heard. Now all the fish in the sea were one-eyed, and he was the Emperor of the City of One-eyed Fish. An endless wall surrounded the desert at the water’s edge, the green sky was rusting on its bricks, and vast shoals of fat, one-eyed fish, monstrous creatures bulging with marine leprosy, were flung against the sides of the red towers, while a dropsical black man shook his fist at an idol of salt.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At other times, Erdosain recalled moments when he knew beforehand what was going to happen to him, as he had told the Captain that fateful night. He felt a confused sense of dismay, a sense of lying in wait for reality in a way that now led him to say to himself: “I was right; I knew all the time.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He remembered how one night he had been talking to Elsa and she, in a moment of sincerity, had confessed that if she had not already been married she would have stayed single and taken a lover instead.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain asked her:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you mean it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elsa replied harshly from the other bed:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course, I’d have taken a lover … what’s the point in getting married?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt a strange deathly silence creeping over him, laid alongside his prostrate body like a coffin. Perhaps it was at that moment that all the unconscious love a man feels for a woman was destroyed in him, freeing him to face terrible situations that he would otherwise have been unable to cope with. He felt he was deep inside a tomb, that he would never again see the light of day, while in the black silence that filled the room, the phantoms his wife’s voice had summoned floated up before him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Later, seeking to explain that episode, he recalled he had lain motionless on his bed, afraid any movement he made might tip over this immense unhappiness constantly pressing his horizontal frame up against merciless despair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His heart was pounding. Each time it contracted, he felt he had to push up the weight of a slippery mass of mud. It was useless for him to try to reach up to grasp the sunlight far above. His wife’s voice still echoed in his ears:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I would never have married. I would have taken a lover.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And those few words, which had taken no more than a couple of seconds to utter, would stay with him for the rest of his life. He clamped his eyes shut. The words would be with him all his life, swelling inside him like a malignant growth. His teeth grated. He wanted to suffer still more, to exhaust himself in pain, to bleed himself dry in a slow dripping of anguish. Stiff as a corpse in its shroud, his hands stretched along his thighs. Head locked forward, not daring to breathe, he asked in a rasping whisper:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And would you have loved him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What for? … Who knows? … oh, and yes, if he was good to me, why not?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where would you have met? They wouldn’t have allowed that kind of thing in your house.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In some hotel or other.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They fell silent, but walled in his unhappiness, Erdosain could already picture her, walking along the pavement of a street as stony as a river-bed. A dark veil covered half her face, as she walked with rapid, sure steps to the place her chosen desire was leading her. Seeking only to extinguish the last remaining glimmer of hope, Erdosain went on, a feigned smile on his face invisible to her in the darkness. He spoke softly so that she would not notice his lips quaking with rage:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“See how nice it is in a marriage to be able to talk about everything like brother and sister? But tell me, would you have stripped off in front of him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t talk nonsense!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, just tell me: would you have stripped off?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … of course! I couldn’t stay dressed, could I?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could not have been more rigid if someone had split his spine with an axe. His throat became as parched as if he had swallowed a mouthful of fire. His heart had almost ceased to beat, and a fog poured from his brain and out of his eyes. He was falling through silence and darkness, floating slowly down into the void while the paralysed block of his flesh only continued to exist in order to register still more deeply the imprint of pain. He did not say a word, though he would have liked to burst out in sobs, to have knelt in front of someone, to get up at that very instant, get dressed, leave the house and go and sleep in some doorway, or on the outskirts of some unknown city.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In his fury, Erdosain finally blurted out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t you realise … don’t you realise how terrible what you’ve said is? I ought to kill you! What a bitch you are! I ought to kill you, I really should! Don’t you realise?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s the matter with you? Have you gone crazy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’ve ruined my life. Now I know why you never gave yourself to me, why you’ve forced me to masturbate. Yes, that too! You’ve turned me into a rag doll. I ought to kill you. Anyone could come up to me and spit in my face. Don’t you realise? And while I’m stealing and swindling and suffering for you, you … yes, that’s what you’re thinking of. Thinking you would have given yourself to a good man! Don’t you realise? A good man … a good man!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you gone crazy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was throwing on his clothes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where are you going?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain struggled into his overcoat, then leaning over his wife’s bed, he shouted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You want to know where I’m going? I’m going to a brothel, to catch a dose of syphilis!”</div>

     INNOCENCE AND IDIOCY <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The chronicler of this story would not risk any definition of Erdosain; the misfortunes in his life were so great that all the disasters he was later to cause in league with the Astrologer could possibly be explained by the traumas he suffered during his marriage.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Even when I read over Erdosain’s confessions once more, I can scarcely believe I had to listen to him baring his soul in such a terrifying way, so overcome by anguish he seemed free from all sense of shame.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I remember it well. During the three days he was holed up in my house, he told me everything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">We would meet in a huge, dimly lit room almost bare of furniture. Erdosain would sit perched on the edge of the seat, slumped forward with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden behind his hands. All the time, he stared down at the floor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He spoke in a monotone, without breaking off, as if he were reciting a lesson etched into the surface of his shadowy consciousness at thousands of pounds’ pressure. Whatever he was talking about, his voice did not vary in the slightest, but kept the steady methodical beat of a pendulum.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">If I interrupted him, he did not get annoyed, but began again from the beginning, adding the details I requested, never once raising his head from staring at the floor, his elbows clamped to his knees. He spoke slowly because of the immense attention he paid to each detail, intent above all on dispelling any confusion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He piled horror on horror without a trace of emotion. He knew he was going to die, that man’s justice was ruthlessly pursuing him, and yet there he was, revolver in pocket, elbows on knees, face hidden behind his hands, staring at the dusty, empty room, and talking without a trace of emotion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In just a few days he had grown extraordinarily thin. His sallow skin stretched taut over the flat bones of his face gave him a consumptive look. Later on, the autopsy confirmed that the illness was already ravaging him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The second day he was in my house he told me:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Before I married, I used to be horrified at the thought of fornication. To my mind, a man married a woman simply to be with her always, to enjoy the pleasure of seeing one another the whole time; to talk to each other, express love through one’s eyes, words and smiles. It’s true I thought that way when I was very young, but when I got engaged to Elsa I felt the need to renew my faith in these things.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He talked and talked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain said he never even kissed Elsa, because he was content to let the vertigo of loving her grip his throat, and also because he believed that “one should not kiss a young lady”. So he converted a craving of his flesh into something spiritual.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We never addressed each other in a familiar manner either, because I liked the distance that a formal way of speaking created between us. I also thought one should not be too familiar with a young lady. No, don’t laugh. To my mind, a ‘young lady’ was the authentic expression of all that is pure, perfect and innocent. Next to her it was not desire I felt, but the stirrings of a wonderful ecstasy that filled my eyes with tears. And I was happy to suffer for my love, unaware of the real goal of my desire, truly believing it was a spiritual passion rather than a terrible bodily upheaval that made me a willing slave to her cool, level gaze, that searching gaze which slowly penetrated the most tumultuous layers of my spirit.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">I would watch Erdosain while he was talking like this. Here was a murderer, a murderer, talking in this way about the absurd subtleties of our emotions! He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then on our wedding night when we were alone in our hotel room, she took off her clothes quite naturally in the lamplight. Blushing to the roots of my hair, I turned away so that she could not see how embarrassed I felt. I removed my shirt collar, my jacket and my boots, then slipped under the sheets with my trousers still on. She turned her head amidst the riot of black curls on her pillow and said with a strange laugh:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Aren’t you worried about creasing them? Take them off, silly.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Later on in their marriage, a mysterious distance kept Elsa and Erdosain apart. She gave herself to him, but always with repugnance, as though she felt cheated in some way. When he knelt at her bedside and begged her to surrender to him if only for a moment, she replied in a voice thick with anger: “Let me alone! Can’t you see you disgust me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Choking back his fear of catastrophe, Erdosain would roll back on to his own bed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I would not lie down, but sit upright, my back propped against the pillow, staring out into the darkness. I knew it made no sense, but I thought that if she could see me lost and alone like that in the shadows, she might have pity on me and at last say: ‘All right, come here if you want to.’ But she never, never said a word to me, until one night I called out in utter despair:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘Do you really think … I’ll just masturbate for ever?’ At that, unmoved, she replied: ‘It’s pointless: I should never have married you.’”</div>

     THE BLACK HOUSE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Anguish took hold of Erdosain, so painfully that all of a sudden he clasped his head as if the pain was about to drive him mad. As each new idea rocked him, it felt as though his brain matter had shaken loose and was slopping against the walls of his skull.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He knew he was lost beyond redemption, stranded far from even the faint happiness that one day shines on the most pallid cheek. He understood that destiny had flung him into that maelstrom of outcasts who stamp life with the foul imprint of every imaginable vice and suffering.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All his hope had gone. His fear of living intensified still further when he realised he had no dreams to keep him going, when he admitted, eyes obstinately fixed on the far corner of the room, that it was all the same to him if he worked as a dishwasher in a bar or as a brothel porter.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What did it matter to him! Anguish threw him into that silent multitude of fearful men who drag their wretchedness through days of selling knick-knacks or bibles, and then at nightfall begin their tour of public lavatories, where they expose their genitals to tender youths brought there by similar uncontrollable desires.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain circled endlessly round and round in these grim considerations. He felt as if he was screwed to a huge block of wood from which he would never struggle free.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Anguish took such deep root in him that he suddenly pitied the fate his body might meet in the city, this seventy-kilo body he only saw whenever he passed in front of a mirror.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In earlier times, Erdosain had delved into his mind to enjoy all kinds of luxury and pleasure &mdash; the kind of immaterial pleasures not circumscribed by time or physical boundaries. But in his present despair he was unable to escape his body, a suffering body which at times he thought of as no longer his, despite his sense of remorse at never having made it happy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The remorse he felt towards his own wretched physical being was as deep as the pain a mother must feel at never being able to satisfy her son’s deepest desires.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had never offered his doomed flesh either a decent suit or a satisfaction that would reconcile it to life; he had done nothing for the pleasure of his own physical being, whereas he had permitted his spirit everything, even flights of fancy to countries as yet undiscovered by man’s machines.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Time and again he said to himself: “What have I done for the happiness of this wretched body of mine?” In truth, he felt he was bound up in something as separate from himself as wine is to the barrel containing it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But he came to realise that it was this body of his that was the container of all his doubts and despair, was what fed them with its weary blood; a wretched, shabbily dressed body that no woman would deign to look at, which suffered all the contempt and crushing weight of the passing days simply because his mind had never desired the pleasures it was timidly, silently, crying out for. Erdosain felt sad and sorry for this physical double of his, this distant acquaintance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So then, like a desperate man who throws himself from a seventh floor, he flung himself into the delicious terror of masturbation, seeking to drown his remorse in a world nobody could ever cast him from, cocooning himself in pleasures that were beyond his grasp in real life, a spectacular array of beautiful bodies he would have needed endless lives and limitless money to really enjoy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This was a universe of gelatinous ideas, chopped into corridors where obscenity was disguised in silks and brocade, in velvets and expensive, creamy laces; a world bathed in a soft, sponge-like sunset glow. The most gorgeous women in creation strolled by, baring the rounded apples of their breasts to him, or offering their scented lips and lascivious words to a mouth stale from vile cigarettes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sometimes they were tall, smart, polished young ladies, at others perverted schoolgirls, an ever-changing world of females that no-one could ever cast him from: him, such a seedy-looking individual that even the madams of the most decrepit brothels eyed him suspiciously, as though he were going to cheat them out of the price of a lay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He closed his eyes and sank into the oblivion of the burning darkness, like an opium-smoker who enters the sordid den with its Chinese owner stinking of excrement and yet believes he is on the threshold of paradise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Slowly but surely he slid surreptitiously towards that forbidden pleasure; ashamed but at the same time as excited as an adolescent going into a whorehouse for the first time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Desire buzzed in his ears like a horsefly, but nobody now could cast him from this sensual darkness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The darkness was a familiar house where he suddenly lost all notion of everyday life. There, in the black house, he revelled in pleasures which if he had so much as suspected another man of enjoying, he would never have gone near him again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Although this black house was deep inside himself, Erdosain entered it in the most roundabout way, performing the most tortuous manoeuvres. Yet once he had crossed the threshold he knew there was no turning back, because down its corridors, down a secret corridor draped in shadows, there came to meet him the same fleet-footed woman who one day in the street, on a tram or in someone’s house, had made him stiffen with desire.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Like someone pulling banknotes earned in many different ways from the same wallet, from the recesses of the dark house Erdosain plucked a fragmented but whole woman, made up from a hundred such creatures split by the same desire repeated a hundred times, always blooming anew in their presence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This imaginary woman had the knees of a girl whose skirt the wind had blown up while she was waiting for a bus; the thighs he remembered from a pornographic postcard; and the sad, wan smile of a schoolgirl he had met a long time ago in a tram; the green eyes of a little dressmaker with spots around her pale mouth, going out on a Sunday evening with a friend to a dance in one of those social clubs where shopkeepers thrust their bulging trouser-fronts at girls who enjoy men.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And this fantasy woman, made up from the bits and pieces of all the ones he had been unable to possess, showed him the same kindness as cautious girls who have fondled their boyfriends’ crotches but still consider themselves decent. She came towards him, wearing a tight orthopaedic girdle that left her slightly splayed breasts free, and her behaviour was above reproach, like that of a proper young lady who knows what’s what, though that does not prevent her allowing her boyfriend’s hands to stray inside her casually undone blouse.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then he would sink into the depths of the black house. The black house! Erdosain had a fearful memory of those days; he felt he had lived in a real hell, the ghastly image of which he could not shake off for the rest of his days, even when close to death, hounded by the law. Whenever his thoughts turned back to that time, he became sombrely excited and a dull red gleam shone in his eyes. He was so painfully aroused he would have liked to have leapt right over the stars, to burn himself in a bonfire that would cleanse his present of all that terrible, enduring, inescapable past.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The black house! I can still see it now &mdash; the haggard face of that sullen man, first tilting up to stare at the ceiling, then lowering his gaze to meet mine while he added, with a frozen smile: “Go on, tell mankind what the black house is. And tell them I was a murderer. And yet I, a murderer, have loved every kind of beauty, and have fought within myself against all the horrible temptations that welled up hour after hour from deep within me. I have suffered for what I am, and for all the others as well, d’you understand? for all the others as well …”</div>

     THE NOTIFICATION <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The kidnapping took place ten days after Elsa had run away. On the fourteenth of August the Astrologer visited Erdosain when he was out, so he came back to find an envelope pushed under his door. It contained a fake notification from the War Ministry giving Captain Belaunde’s supposed address, plus a curious postscript which read as follows:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll be waiting for you and Barsut every morning between ten and eleven until the twentieth. Knock and come in straightaway. Don’t come alone.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer’s letter gave Erdosain pause for thought. He had completely forgotten Barsut. First he had decided he had to kill him, then that decision had become shrouded in darkness, and the intervening days when he was shut up alone had now come and gone. “I had to kill Barsut.” Perhaps the key to Erdosain’s madness might be found in an explanation of that “had to”. When I asked him about it, he replied: “I had to kill him, otherwise I could not have lived at peace with myself. To kill Barsut was a prerequisite for living, just as breathing fresh air is for others.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As soon as he received the letter, he headed for Barsut’s place. Barsut lived in a rooming-house full of a fantastic array of people. The owner devoted herself to spiritualism, had a cross-eyed daughter and was implacable about the rent. Any lodger who was so much as twenty-four hours late in paying was sure to come back in the evening and find all his cases and belongings thrown out into the centre of the yard.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was nightfall when Erdosain arrived. As he came into the room Barsut was in the midst of shaving. Barsut turned pale and paused with the razor on his cheek, then stared Erdosain up and down and exclaimed: “What on earth are you doing here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Anyone else would have been offended,” Erdosain commented to me later. “But I smiled at him ‘in a friendly way’, because I did feel strangely friendly towards him at moments like that, and handed him the notification from the War Ministry. An inexplicable joy made me nervous: I can remember sitting on the edge of his bed for a minute, then leaping up and pacing up and down the room.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So she’s in Temperley. And you want us to go and fetch her?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s what I want. I want you to go and fetch her.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut muttered something Erdosain could not understand, then began to rub the muscles on his arms until there was a pink glow to his skin. He picked up the razor to trim the ends of his moustache, turned his head towards Erdosain and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Y’know something? I never thought you’d have the guts to come and visit me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain withstood the striated green gaze &mdash; no doubt about it, the man had the face of a tiger &mdash; then folded his arms and argued back:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s true, I thought the same, but as you can see, things change …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you scared to go alone?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, but I’m interested in getting you involved in the affair …” Barsut clenched his teeth. His chin covered in lather, his brow furrowed, he weighed Erdosain up again and eventually said: “Look, I thought I was bad enough, but I reckon that you … you’re worse than I am. But anyway, it’s in God’s hands.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why do you say that: ‘it’s in God’s hands’?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut stared into the shaving mirror, arms akimbo. The words he then spoke came as no surprise to Erdosain, who listened to them without a flicker of reaction on his face: “Who’s to say that this notification isn’t a fake and you’re not laying a trap to kill me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How strange a man’s soul can be!” Erdosain commented later. “I heard those words, and not a single muscle of my face moved. How had Gregorio guessed at the truth? I’ve no idea. Or did he simply have the same perverse imagination as me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain lit a cigarette and replied no more than: “Do as you like.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But Barsut, who seemed in a mood to talk, went on: “Why not though? Answer me that: why not? What’s so strange about you wanting to kill me? It’s only logical. I wanted to steal your wife, I informed on you, I beat you up: good God, you’d have to be a saint not to want to kill me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A saint! no, my friend, that I’m not. But I promise you I’m not going to kill you tomorrow. Some day yes, but not tomorrow.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut burst out laughing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re really something, Remo, d’you know that? Some day you’ll kill me. How weird can you get? D’you know what really fascinates me? Imagining the look on your face as you do it. Tell me, will you look serious, or will you be laughing?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The tone of his questions was grave, but not hostile.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll probably be serious. I don’t know. Probably. Killing someone is no easy matter, after all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you’re not scared of prison?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, because if I killed you I’d have taken my precautions, and I’d get rid of your body with sulphuric acid.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re a monster … oh, by the way, my memory is hopeless: did you pay the Sugar Company back?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who gave you the money?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A thug.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You don’t have many friends, but they’re loyal all right … so, what time are you coming for me tomorrow?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Captain goes on duty at eight … so after that …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look, I’m still not convinced you’re telling the truth, but if Elsa is there, I’ll give her such a hiding I warn you it’ll take her a good few years to get over it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When Erdosain left he headed straight for a telegraph office and sent a cable to the Astrologer.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-66" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-23" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897201592720" class="calibre10"></a>
     THE WORK OF ANGUISH <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">That night Erdosain could not sleep. He was exhausted. Nor could he concentrate on anything. He tried to explain his state of mind to me in the following terms:<sup class="calibre15">2</sup></div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s as if the soul were floating half a metre above the body. You feel as if all your muscles have crumbled away, an unending sense of anguish. You close your eyes and it’s as if your body were dissolving into nothingness, then all of a sudden you recall a tiny forgotten detail from somewhere out of the thousands of days you’ve lived. Don’t ever commit a crime &mdash; it’s the sadness this memory creates rather than the horror that’s so terrible. You feel you’re cutting your links with society one by one, that you’re plunging into a shadowy world of savagery, that you’ve lost all sense of direction; they say &mdash; I said it myself to the Astrologer that it’s due to not being a hardened criminal &mdash; but that’s not true. In fact, you want to live like everyone else does, to be decent like everyone else, to have a home, a wife, to look out of your window at the passers-by, and yet there is not a single cell of your body left that isn’t marked with the fatal message contained in those words “I have to kill him”. You can argue I’m simply trying to explain away my hatred. How could I not try to do so? I feel as if I’m living a dream. I even realise I’m talking so much because I need to convince myself I am not dead, not because of what’s happened but because of the state something like this leaves you in. Like skin after a bad burn. It eventually gets better, but have you noticed how it looks? All wrinkled, dry, hard, shiny. That’s how one’s soul becomes. It shines so brightly it can blind you. And its wrinkles horrify you. You know you have a monster inside that can break loose at any moment, and you don’t know which way it will leap.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A monster! I’ve often thought it. A lazy, supple, enigmatic monster capable of surprising even yourself with its violent impulses, with the devilish twists it uncovers in the hidden recesses of life, the way it can discover evil from any angle. How often I’ve paused in front of myself, of the mystery that is me, and envied the life of the most humble of men! Ah! Don’t ever commit a crime. Look at how I am. I’m confessing all this to you because yes, I think you may understand …</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And that night? … By the time I reached home it was late. I threw myself down on my bed fully dressed. My heart was beating frantically like a gambler’s must do. In fact, I was not worried about what might happen after the crime, but even as I was on the point of committing it, I was curious to know how I would behave, what Barsut might do, how the Astrologer intended to kidnap him. Whereas novels I had read presented crime as fascinating, to me it seemed no more than a mechanical act &mdash; committing a crime is easy; it merely seems so complicated to us because we aren’t used to it, that’s all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The truth is I remember just lying there staring at the far corner of the darkened room. Disparate tatters of my former existence floated by as if carried on the wind. I’ve never been able to understand the mysterious way that memory works &mdash; how during the most momentous occasions of our lives, an insignificant detail or an image that present concerns have blotted out from our memory, suddenly becomes immensely important. We were unaware that these inner photos even existed, until the thick veil is torn from them. So it was that throughout that night, instead of thinking about Barsut I simply lay there, in that desolate room, like a man waiting expectantly for something to happen, that extraordinary something I’ve so often told you about, which I imagined would give a completely new twist to my life, cancel out my past, show me I was an entirely different man from the one I seemed to be.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In fact, I wasn’t worried so much about the crime as about something else: what would I be like after it? Would I feel remorse? Would I go mad, or would I end up turning myself in? Or would I simply carry on living the way I had before, suffering from that strange incapacity which robbed my actions of all coherence &mdash; what you now say is the symptom of my madness?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The curious thing is that at times I felt great surges of joy welling up in me, or the need to feign a fit of madness that did not exist. I fought down the urge, and tried to figure out how exactly we were going to kidnap Barsut. I was sure he would put up a fight, but I knew the Astrologer was not someone to get into an affair like that unprepared. I also wondered how Barsut had guessed that the notification from the War Ministry was a fake, and couldn’t help admiring the presence of mind I had shown when he turned his soapy face to me and said, half seriously: ‘It’d be strange, wouldn’t it, if the letter were a forgery?’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He was a swine all right, but I wasn’t far behind him; perhaps the only difference between us was that he did not have the same curiosity about the low passions which drove him on. In any case, by then I was past caring. It might be me who killed him, or the Astrologer &mdash; the fact was I had plunged my life into some monstrous hole where the demons played with my senses like dice in a tumbler.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Noises reached me from afar; weariness seeped into my bones; at times it seemed to me my flesh was soaking up silence and any chance of rest like a sponge. I kept getting hideous ideas about Elsa; a silent rancour clamped my mouth shut; I was full of pity for my own poor life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yet the only way I could imagine redeeming myself in my own eyes was by killing Barsut, and all at once I would picture myself standing beside him. He was tied up with thick ropes and lay sprawled on a heap of sacks: all I could make out clearly was one green eye in profile, and his pale nose. I bent quietly over his body pointing a revolver: I gently pushed his hair back and told him in a soft voice: ‘You’re going to die, you bastard.’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The body trembled, and I raised the revolver and held it to his temple, repeating in the same soft voice: ‘You’re going to die, you bastard.’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“His arms writhed under the thick cords; his body was a seething mass of terrified muscle and bone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘Do you remember, you bastard, d’you remember the potatoes, the salad you spilt all over the table? Do I still have the look of an idiot that so annoyed you then?’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But all of a sudden I became ashamed of taunting him like that, so I said to him &mdash; or rather, no, I said nothing to him, but took a sack and pulled it over his head. Underneath the coarse burlap, the head started thrashing about furiously. I tried to force it to the floor to make sure of my aim and to steady the gun barrel, but the sacking slid off his hair and I did not have the strength to control this raging beast snorting desperately in its fight against death. Then when that dream faded, I saw myself sailing through the Malaysian archipelago, or on a ship in the Indian Ocean. I had changed my name, I growled out English: my sadness might have been the same, but now I had powerful arms, and a calm gaze; perhaps in Borneo or in Calcutta, or on the far shores of the Red Sea, or beyond the forests of Siberia, in Korea or Manchuria, I could rebuild my life.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Gone were the dreams of the inventor and the man who discovered electric rays so powerful they could melt steel blocks as if they were blobs of wax, or who presided over the glass-topped tables of the League of Nations.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At other moments, Erdosain was in the grip of terror: he felt he was in shackles &mdash; loathsome civilisation had put him in a straitjacket he had no chance of escaping from. He could picture himself in chains, wearing a striped uniform, trudging slowly in a column of prisoners through mounds of snow towards the forests of Ushuaia. The sky above was as white as a sheet of tin.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This vision drove him wild: consumed by a blind rage, he got up and paced from one end of the room to the other, wanting to beat his fists against the walls, or drill holes into them with his bones. He came to a halt in the door jamb, and crossed his arms tightly as the choking sorrow surged up in him once more. Whatever he did was futile: there was one single, irrefutable reality in his life. Him and the others. There was an unbridgeable distance between him and the others, due to their lack of understanding or to his own madness. Either way, he was doomed. And fragments of his past continued to rise before his eyes: the truth was he wanted above all to escape from himself, to quit once and for all the life that encompassed his body and at the same time poisoned it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Oh! To be able to enter a new world, with broad avenues stretching out in the forests, where the reek of the wild animals was sweet in comparison to the ghastly presence of man.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He paced round and round, trying to exhaust his body, to tire it out utterly, to crush it until it was so weary he would be unable to form even a single idea.</div>

     THE KIDNAPPING <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">At nine the next morning, Erdosain went to meet Barsut. They left the house without a word. Later on, Erdosain wondered about that strange journey when the other man went towards his fate without so much as a murmur.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Referring to that occasion, he commented:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I went with Barsut like a condemned man being taken to his place of execution, drained of all strength; my only sensation was a persistent feeling of emptiness that invaded every pore of my body.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Barsut himself sat there scowling; I could sense that as he rode along with his elbow on the rail he was gathering his rage, ready to unleash it on the invisible enemy instinct told him was concealed in the house at Temperley.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“From time to time it occurred to me how strange it would have been if the other passengers had known that those two men sitting hunched on the leather padding of their seats were a would-be assassin and his victim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And yet everything went on as before. The sun shone over the fields: we’d left the meat-packing plants behind, the tallow and soap factories, the glass and iron foundries, the stockyards with cattle sniffing at the posts, the avenues still to be properly surfaced, strewn with rubble and full of ruts. And then beyond Lantis we came on the awful spectacle of Remedios de Escalada, with its ghastly redbrick roundhouses and their blackened openings, where locomotives shunted to and fro under the arches, while in the distance, between the tracks, gangs of poor wretches were shovelling ballast or hauling railway sleepers.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Further on still, in among a straggling vegetation of plane trees choked by soot and petrol fumes, stood a diagonal line of red cottages where the railway company employees lived, with their tiny gardens, shutters grimy from the smoke, paths of cinders and ashes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut was lost in his thoughts. Erdosain, to put it precisely, let himself be. If at that very moment he had seen a train hurtling towards them on the same track, he would not have so much as blinked, so little did he care whether he lived or died.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So the journey passed. When they drew into Temperley, Barsut shook himself as if waking with a start from a distressing dream. All he said was: “Which way now?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stretched out his arm, pointing vaguely in the direction they had to go. Barsut set off. They walked in silence down the streets leading to the Astrologer’s house. The soft blue of morning fell on the walls of the diagonal streets.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Shoots, bushes and trees of every shade of green created a jumbled architecture of vegetation, rounded off above their heads by swaying plumes, and crisscrossed by a maze of red woodstems. The gentle breeze seemed to make these fantastic chance constructions of botany float in a golden aura that shone as clear as a concave mirror, and held beneath its dome all the heady perfume of the earth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Beautiful morning,” Barsut said.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">That was all either of them said until they were outside the property. “This is it,” said Erdosain. Barsut leapt back and, with a piercing look, asked him: “And how do you know this is it, if there’s no number?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Commenting on this incident later, Erdosain remarked: “It just shows there must be an instinct for crime, one which allows you to lie on the spot without fear of contradicting yourself, similar to the instinct for self-preservation which, just when everything seems lost, enables you to discover means of escape you had never dreamt of.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked up and said so calmly that he was only later astounded at it: “Because I came snooping round here yesterday. I wanted to see if I could spot Elsa.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut eyed him suspiciously.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He could have sworn Erdosain was lying,<sup class="calibre15">3</sup> but his pride would not allow him to back out, so while Erdosain called, he clapped his hands loudly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In shirtsleeves, and wearing a straw hat whose broad brim covered half his face, the Man Who Saw the Midwife came out to the red-painted wire gate.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is the lady of the house in?” Barsut asked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Making no reply, Bromberg slid back the bolt and opened the gate: then he set off down a winding path that led to the house through a eucalyptus grove. The two men followed. All at once a voice called out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where are you going?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut looked round. As he did so, Bromberg turned on his heel, and his arm flashed out as if a spring in it had suddenly snapped.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut’s mouth dropped open in a desperate search for air as he doubled up in pain. He tried to clasp his stomach with his hands, but Bromberg’s arm arched forward again, and a right cross to the jaw rattled Barsut’s teeth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He fell to the ground and lay slumped so still he might have been dead, with his legs drawn up under him and his lips slightly parted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer appeared, while a serious, almost sad-looking Bromberg leant over the fallen man.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer grabbed Barsut’s arms, his hands hooking like claws under the armpits, and the two of them dragged him off to the abandoned coachhouse. As Erdosain rolled back the ochre-painted door, a smell of dry hay and a swarm of insects poured from the black depths within. They put the unconscious Barsut in a horsebox: a heavy chain was secured to one of the posts by a padlock.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer wrapped one end of the chain around Barsut’s ankle, knotted the links several times, and fastened it with the padlock, which creaked as he opened it. Straightening up from their prisoner, Erdosain looked at the Astrologer and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Too bad &mdash; he hasn’t got his cheque book on him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was ten in the morning. The Astrologer glanced at his watch and said: “I’ve got time to catch the express that gets to Rosario at six. Will you come with me to Retiro?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re going to Rosario?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I’ve got to send the telegram to his landlady, remember? Do you have her address?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I’ve got all the details.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s the best way to get hold of Barsut’s stuff without arousing suspicion. Does he keep everything at the rooming-house?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, the trunk and two cases.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Fine. Now let’s cut the conversation and get down to business. By six this evening I’ll be in Rosario, I’ll send the cable to the landlady, and you call round there tomorrow morning around ten. Play the innocent and ask whether Barsut has reached Rosario yet, because you haven’t heard from him and you know he’s been offered an important job, and so on. How does that sound?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Fine.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At twelve o’clock, the Astrologer was boarding the train.</div>
    <br class="calibre1" />
    <div class="paragraph">Footnotes</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">1</sup> Referring to those days, Erdosain told me: “I thought I’d been given a soul to enjoy the beauties of this world: moonlight shimmering behind the orange-hued crest of a nighttime cloud, a drop of dew quivering on the tip of a rose. When I was a child, I even believed life held something sublime and beautiful just for me. But as I came to discover other people’s lives, I found everyone of them was bored, as if they lived in a land where the rain never ceased, and left beams of water deep in their eyes which distorted their vision of the world. Then I understood that souls moved around on this earth like fish trapped in an aquarium. Life, real and wonderful, was beyond the weed-green glass walls: there, everything would be different, full of energy and variety, and the new beings of this more perfect creation would soar through a balmy atmosphere.” And he would add: “It’s hopeless, I have to escape from this world.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">2</sup> One day I hope to write the account of how Erdosain spent those ten days. It is impossible for me to do so now, because it would require another book as long as this present one. Bear in mind that this study is confined to only three days of the protagonists’ actions, and that despite the space I have given myself, I can do no more than hint at their subjective states. The action will continue in another volume, to be entitled <em class="calibre11">The Flamethrowers</em>. Erdosain supplied me with copious information for that second part, which will contain such extraordinary episodes as: “The Blind Prostitute”, “Elsa’s Adventures”, “The Man Who Walked with Jesus”, and “The Poison Gas Factory”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><sup class="calibre15">3</sup> In a conversation Barsut had with the Astrologer, he said that the night before the abduction he had thought it might be an ambush to kill him, but that at the last moment a sense of pride kept him from backing out.</div>

     THE WHIP <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The ruse Erdosain had thought up and the Astrologer carried out was so successful that the Astrologer decided to hold the first meeting for the “chiefs” to get to know each other on the following Wednesday. On Tuesday afternoon at four, he went to tell Erdosain they would all be meeting in Temperley at nine o’clock the next morning.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was with Erdosain for a few minutes, and as they were coming out of the house, he suddenly glanced at his watch in panic and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Goodness, it’s four o’clock already, and I’ve got lots of places to visit still … I’ll see you at nine tomorrow … oh, by the way, I was thinking that there’s only one person who could be our Chief of Industry, and that’s you. Anyway, we’ll talk more about it tomorrow … Oh, and don’t forget to present … or rather, don’t forget to prepare a plan to build hydraulic turbines, a simple scheme we could install in the mountains. We’d use it in our colony for the electro-magnetic work we need to do.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How many kilowatts?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve no idea … that’s your business. Remember, there’ll be electric furnaces … you’ll have to sort it out. The Gold Prospector’s arrived, he can give you more specific details tomorrow. Just make sure you’re prepared when the idea is suggested. Damn, it’s getting late … I’ll see you tomorrow.” He put his hat on, hailed a passing cab, and settled on the back seat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The next day, as Erdosain walked along the streets of Temperley he was astonished to find that for the first time in many months he felt calm and relaxed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He strolled along. The tunnels of vegetation he passed through gave him the sense of some titanic, uncontainable effort taking place. He stared with delight at the red gravel paths in the gardens, reaching their scarlet feelers out towards the fields, green baize cloths studded with purple, yellow and red flowers. If he looked up, he could see the watery blue depths of the sky, which made his head spin so much that the heavens suddenly disappeared from his sight, leaving him with a blinding black flash on the retinas of his eyes, before he gradually recovered his sight in a stealthy fluttering of silver atoms, which turned slowly into an image of harsh dry blue slates, like methylene-blue caves. And the sensation of pleasure the morning gave him, this new delight, helped unite the broken shards of his personality, shattered as it had been by all the sufferings that disaster had inflicted on him. He felt as though his body were ready for anything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The words he kept repeating to himself were: “Augusto Remo Erdosain”, as if simply saying his name gave him a physical pleasure which redoubled the energy the walk had infused in his limbs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He walked on down the diagonal streets in the shafts of sunlight, rejoicing in the power of his brand-new personality: Chief of Industry. The cool freshness of this botanical stroll filled his mind with great ideas. And this satisfaction helped ground him in the streets, like a doll with lead weights in its shoes. He was thinking of how disdainful he would be at the meeting, and he was gripped by a cold contempt for the weak of this world. The earth belonged to the strong &mdash; that was it, to the strong. They would take the world by storm, until they came face-to-face with the imbeciles who stuff their backsides into a chair in every office in every country, while they themselves were armoured in their grandeur like solitary, ruthless emperors. Erdosain again imagined an immense office with glass walls and a round table at its centre.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Papers in hand, pens pushed back behind their ears, his four assistants tiptoed over to consult him, while in a corner the white haired workers’ representatives sat cowed. Then Erdosain turned towards them and simply said: “Either you all go back to work tomorrow or you’ll be shot.” That and nothing more. His orders were brief and softly spoken. His arm ached from signing so many decrees. The voracious appetite of the times kept him going, its need for a tiger’s soul to embellish each day’s end with its quota of bloody executions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He drew close to the Astrologer’s house, his heart pulsing with renewed enthusiasm, repeating to himself like a haunting refrain Lenin’s phrase: “What kind of a revolution is this if we don’t shoot anyone?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he reached the property and was opening the front gate, he saw the Astrologer coming to meet him, dressed as usual in a long grey smock and wearing a straw hat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two friends shook hands warmly, and the Astrologer said: “Barsut’s calmed down. I don’t think he’s going to put up too much of a fight about signing the cheque. The others have arrived, but let’s go to see Barsut first. Let them wait, damn it! Can you imagine how I feel? With that money, the world is ours.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By now they were in the study. The Astrologer was twisting the purple stone on his finger and staring at the map of the United States. He went on: “We shall conquer the earth, we’ll bring our ‘grand idea’ to fruition, we can set up a brothel in San Martin or in Ciudadela, we can establish our colony in the mountains at Los Santos. Who better to take charge of the brothel than the Melancholy Thug? We’ll appoint him our ‘Grand Patriarch of the Brothels’.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain went over to the window … the rose bushes gave off a piercing scent, filling the air with a fresh red fragrance like a mountain stream. Bright-winged insects buzzed around the scarlet asterisks in the pomegranate trees. Erdosain stood gazing out for a few moments. The view took him back to the afternoon he had been there in that very same spot. And yet then he had been completely unaware of what the night held in store for him: the shock of Elsa’s departure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The many shades of green flooded his eyes, but he paid them no attention. In his inner depths what he saw was his wife, her cheek resting against the purple nipples of a square male chest, limp, her eyes rolled back, lips parted to receive the man’s obscene mouth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A bird crossed his field of vision, and Erdosain turned back to the Astrologer and said, struggling to control his voice: “Do whatever you like.” He sat down, lit a cigarette, and glancing over at the Astrologer, who was busy drawing a circle on a blueprint with a pair of compasses, asked him: “But how will you do it? Will the Melancholy Thug agree to manage the brothels?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s no problem, and Barsut isn’t going to put up much of a fight.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is he still in the coachhouse?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I thought I’d better hide him. I chained him up in the stables.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In the stables?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was the only place I could keep him hidden. And besides, there’s a room up above where the Man Who Saw the Midwife sleeps …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that all about?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll tell you some day. He saw the midwife and ever since, he can’t sleep at night. And I thought that you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What, it’s going to be me who …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Let me finish. I thought you could go and see Barsut and try to persuade him to sign &mdash; explain our ideas to him …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What if he won’t sign?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then we’ll have to use force … Naturally I’m against violence, but you can see the spot I’m in. Our idea is so important we can’t let any feelings get in the way &mdash; and that’s what you must tell Barsut &mdash; tell him we wouldn’t like to find ourselves forced to burn his feet or something worse still &mdash; get him to sign the cheque.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re prepared to go that far?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, because we won’t get an opportunity like this again. I was counting on your copper rose invention, but it’s taking time. It’s no good asking the Melancholy Thug for the money. If he hasn’t got it, we’d make him feel bad, and if he does have it but won’t give it us, we’d be losing a friend. The fact that he was generous with you doesn’t mean he would be again with us now. Also, he’s a neurotic who most of the time has no idea if he’s coming or going.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was staring out through the rectangles made by the window frames at the scarlet stains in the tops of the pomegranate trees. A golden strip of sunlight lit the upper half of one wall in the room. A vast sadness overwhelmed his heart. What had he done with his life?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer noted how silent he had become, and said: “Look, Erdosain, there’s nothing for it but to risk everything or give up now. That’s the way things are. It’s sad … but what else are we to do? I know it would be much nicer if these things could be done without any sacrifice …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The thing is, in this case it’s someone else we’re sacrificing …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And ourselves, Erdosain, don’t forget we’re risking prison and sacrificing our freedom for God knows how long. Have you never read Plutarch’s <em class="calibre11">Parallel Lives</em>?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, I’ll lend you the book, then you’ll discover that human life is worth less than a dog’s, if it’s a matter of sacrificing that life to change the direction of society. Can you imagine how many murders it takes for someone like Lenin or Mussolini to triumph? People don’t want to know … why? Because Lenin and Mussolini came out on top. That’s the only thing that matters, that’s what justifies any cause, just or unjust.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who’s going to kill Barsut?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Bromberg, the Man Who Saw the Midwife.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You didn’t tell me that …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There was no reason to, we’d already settled it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A wave of fragrance inundated the room. The sound of water dripping into the rainbutt stood out clearly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So who exactly knows about this?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You, me and Bromberg …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Too many people to keep a secret …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, because Bromberg is my slave, and what’s worse, he’s his own slave.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s all very well, but what I want from you is a signed piece of paper in which you and Bromberg confess to being the perpetrators of the crime.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What do you want that for?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“To make sure you don’t double-cross me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer absent-mindedly pushed his hat down, then cupped his mongoloid face in his thick fingers, and walked towards the centre of the room, resting his elbow in the palm of his other hand. He took up again:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have no problem giving you what you’re asking for, but just remember this. My life is totally devoted to carrying out my idea. Great times are just around the corner. I don’t have the time or the inclination to tell you of all the wonders that are about to happen. There’s no doubt a new age is dawning. Who will see it? The elect. And the day I can find someone to take over once the idea is launched, I’ll retire to the mountains to meditate. Until then, everyone around me owes me complete obedience. That’s something you must understand, if you don’t want to go the same way as Barsut …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s no way to talk.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes it is, because I am going to sign the piece of paper you’ve asked me for.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t need it …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Will you need money?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, 2,000 pesos to …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t want to know. You’ll get it …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And also, I don’t want anything to do with the brothel side of things …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Fine, you can look after the accounts; but d’you know what we’re missing as of now? We need to find some vulgar symbol that will rouse the masses …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Lucifer.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, that’s a mystical symbol … too intellectual … what we need is something cheap and stupid … something that appeals directly to the senses of the masses, like the black shirt … that devil is a genius, you know. He realised that the Italian people have the psychology of barbers and comic-opera tenors … Anyway, we’ll see … I’ve already had an interesting idea for the different hierarchies in our society … we can talk about it some other day … it might work …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The thing is for us to be self-supporting …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That goes without saying… the brothels will make money … But, look here, aren’t you going to see Barsut? Have you thought what you’ll say to him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain went out to the coachhouse, where the stables were. It was a heavy stone building with a lot of empty, rat-infested rooms on the top floor. In one of them lived, or rather slept, the sinister Bromberg, whom Erdosain had seen the day of the kidnapping.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain realised he was getting ever deeper into something which was bound to ruin his life in ways he could not even imagine, and this realisation, coupled with his complete lack of enthusiasm for the Astrologer’s plans, gave him the feeling of play-acting, of deliberately creating this absurd situation. “Everything had failed in me,” he was to tell me later; and yet he overcame his fatigue and his indifference and carried on towards the coachhouse. His heart was pounding at the thought of “meeting the enemy”. He furrowed his brow and his anger showed plainly on his face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He undid the padlock, loosened the chain, and with a sudden surge of curiosity slid back one of the sliding doors. Barsut was sitting in his undershirt, about to eat, in a circle of yellow light cast on to a pine table by a kerosene lamp.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Above him hung the metal triangle of a feeding-rack in a wooden horse stall. When he saw Erdosain scowling at him, he paused in the act of pouring oil on to a plate of cold meat and potatoes, but then, without a word to show his surprise, immersed himself once again in his nutritious task. He stretched out, took a pinch of salt between his fingers, and sprinkled it on the potatoes. He kept an air of studied composure even though his black armpit was clearly visible through a hole in the red undershirt.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The way Barsut stared intently down at the meat showed he placed far more importance on his meal than on Erdosain, who was standing only a few paces from him. The rest of the stable was in darkness. Shafts of sunlight slanted down through chinks in the walls, tracing porous gold discs in the dust of the floor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut would not deign to look up. He steadied the loaf of bread on the table, hacked off a piece, and poured himself some soda water, first carefully squirting some on to the ground to clean the nozzle. Then he bent over still further to read a paperback by the side of his plate, while he chewed on a mouthful of meat, bread and potatoes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly sickened by the smell of hay, Erdosain leant against a pillar holding up the roof. He peered through narrowed eyes at Barsut, half of whose face was dimly lit by the green glow from outside, while his moving jaws stood out in the harsh lamplight. It was then Erdosain noticed a whip hanging from the wall.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain started at the sight. It had a long butt and a short lash. Following his gaze, Barsut curled his lip derisively. Erdosain looked first at the whip, then at the prisoner, and a smile spread across his face. He went over to the corner and unhooked the whip. Suddenly Barsut was on his feet, his body straining out of the box, as he stared wildly at him. The veins bulged in his neck. He was about to speak, but his pride kept him from saying a word. A sharp crack rang out. Erdosain had snapped the whip against the wooden partition to see how supple the leather was. But then he merely shrugged his shoulders, and a streak of black flashed across the rays slanting down through the darkness, as the whip fell on to the hay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain walked silently up and down the stable. He thought of the life he was holding in his hands, but the feeling made him no happier. Above the stall partition, Barsut was gazing through the open front door at the sunlit field outside.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Things had changed. That was all there was to it. Erdosain stared angrily at Barsut and asked: “Are you going to sign the cheque or not?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut shrugged; Erdosain did not repeat his question. Perhaps one day at this very same hour he would find himself in some dark cell where suddenly like Barsut his memory would conjure up the scene of a red clay court by a riverside, the sky framed through the strings of young girls’ tennis racquets. He was unable to prevent himself shouting out, more to himself than to Barsut:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you remember? You said I looked like an idiot? Don’t say a word. You had no idea how much I was suffering. Neither you nor her. The fact is, I am sad. It’s you and her who have got me into all this. I don’t even know why I’m talking to you. All I know is I’m so weary. What’s the point …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was about to leave the stable when the Astrologer appeared. Barsut glanced anxiously at his hands; the Astrologer settled his hat on the back of his head, took the lamp, blew it out, and sat down on a trunk. He began:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I came to see you to sort out the cheque business. You must know that’s why we kidnapped you. Of course, I wouldn’t be talking to you like this if it weren’t for the fact that in a notebook we found in your pocket &mdash; which I prevented Erdosain from burning<sup class="calibre15">1</sup> &mdash; I read a simply amazing thought: ‘Money makes a god of man. Therefore Ford is a god. And if he is a god, he can destroy the moon.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was a complete fabrication, but Barsut did not react.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was studying the Astrologer’s impenetrable oblong face. It was obvious he was putting on an act, and that Barsut was not taken in by it, convinced he was being duped.</div>

     THE ASTROLOGER’S SPEECH <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“At first, I thought that observation of yours was just another of the pathetic remarks scattered throughout your jottings … and yet in the end, despite myself, I began to wonder why money can make a god of a man, and suddenly I realised you had hit upon a fundamental truth. And do you know how I could prove you were right? Because I thought that thanks to his fortune Henry Ford would be able to buy enough explosives to blow up a planet such as the moon. So your proposition was correct.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course,” growled Barsut, secretly pleased at the praise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then I realised that not only the entire classical world, but writers of every age &mdash; except for yourself, who had stumbled on that truth without knowing how to take advantage of it &mdash; all of them had been unable to realise that men like Ford, Rockefeller or Morgan were capable of destroying the moon … that they had the power to do so … a power which, as I say, many mythologies attribute to a creator god. So, unknowingly, you were laying the foundation for the realm of the superman.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut turned to observe the Astrologer. Erdosain realised he was speaking seriously.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, when I understood that thanks to the power money gave them, Morgan, Rockefeller or Ford were like gods, I also understood that social revolution would be impossible here on earth, because a Rockefeller or a Morgan could wipe out a race with a snap of their fingers, just as you trample on an ant-hill in your garden.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So long as they had the courage to do it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The courage? What I was wondering was whether a god could renounce his powers … if copper kings or oil barons would ever allow themselves to be stripped of their fleets, mountains, their gold or their wells. I saw that for this to happen they would need to be as spiritual as a Buddha or a Christ … and that gods like these who had all the power would never accept being dispossessed. For that, something truly extraordinary would need to happen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t follow you … I jotted that idea down for completely different reasons.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That doesn’t matter. The extraordinary thing is this: humanity, masses all over the earth, have lost their faith. I don’t mean the Catholic faith. I mean all religious belief. So men are bound to say to themselves: ‘What are our lives for?’ Once science has extinguished all faith, nobody will want to go on with a purely mechanical existence. And the moment that this phenomenon occurs, an incurable plague will return to the earth … the plague of suicide … Can you picture a world of desperate people, their brains shrivelled, lost in the caverns of our gigantic cities, wailing at the foot of concrete walls: ‘What have they done to our God?’ And young girls and schoolkids organising secret societies where they practise the sport of suicide? Or men refusing to have any children, despite Berthelot’s naive prediction that they could all be fed with synthetic pills?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That sounds a bit far-fetched,” said Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer turned towards him in amazement. He had completely forgotten his existence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, none of this will happen until mankind discovers the source of its unhappiness. That’s what went wrong with the revolutionary movements based on economics. Judaism sniffed at the world’s debit and credit entries and concluded: ‘Happiness is bankrupt because mankind lacks the wherewithal to meet its needs …’ whereas the true conclusion is that ‘happiness is bankrupt because mankind lacks gods and faith’.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now you’re contradicting yourself! You said before that …” protested Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Be quiet: what d’you know anyway? So then I realised that this was the dreadful metaphysical sickness everyone is suffering from. Man’s happiness depends on a metaphysical lie … if you deprive him of that lie, he will turn to economic illusions … and then it came to me that the only ones who could restore man’s lost paradise were the flesh and blood gods: Rockefeller, Morgan, Ford … so I thought up a plan which might seem far-fetched to an inferior mind … I saw that there was only one way out of the blind alley of social reality … and that was to take a step backwards.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut was now sitting on the edge of the table, his arms folded.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His green eyes were fixed on the Astrologer who, with his smock buttoned up to his throat and his unkempt hair waving freely, was pacing up and down the coachhouse, absent-mindedly pushing aside the bunches of hay strewn on the floor with the toe of his boot. Erdosain was still leaning against the post. He studied Barsut’s face, watching as an ironic, almost malevolent look crept over it, as if the Astrologer’s words were worthy only of contempt. The Astrologer would walk, come to a halt and tug at his own hair as if he were listening to himself speak. He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, a moment will come when unbelieving mankind, driven wild by all its pleasures, blasphemous in its impotence, will be driven so far out of its mind that it will have to be put down like a mad dog …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What are you saying?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It will be like pruning the human tree … a harvest which only those millionaires, with science at their service, will be able to carry out. Sickened by reality, and no longer believing in science as a source of happiness, these gods &mdash; with their cohorts of tiger-slaves &mdash; will cause appalling disasters, let loose catastrophic plagues … for several decades, the task of the supermen and their slaves will be to destroy mankind in a thousand ways until the whole world is almost consumed … and only a remainder, a tiny remainder will be set apart on some small island &mdash; and they will serve to build the foundations of a new society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut had stood up. Hands stuffed in his trouser pockets, he glared at the Astrologer, then shrugged and asked: “Can it really be that you believe in all this nonsense?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, it’s not nonsense &mdash; I myself would do it, if only to amuse myself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And he continued: “Anyway, the main thing is there are enough unfortunates who will believe it … but my idea is this: there will be two castes in this new society, with a gap between them … or rather, an intellectual void of some thirty centuries between the two. The majority will live carefully kept in the most complete ignorance, surrounded by apocryphal miracles, which are far more interesting than the historical kind, while the minority will be the ones who have access to science and power. That is how happiness will be guaranteed for the majority, because the people of this caste will be in touch with the divine world, which today they are lacking. The minority will administer the herd’s pleasures and miracles, and the golden age, the age in which angels roam along paths at twilight and gods are seen by moonlight, will come to pass.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But that’s a monstrous idea. It could never happen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why not? Oh, I know it couldn’t happen, but we have to proceed as if it were possible.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Everything is upside down … and science …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“To hell with science! Have you any idea what its purpose is? And didn’t you make fun of geniuses in your notebook and say they were ‘infatuated with all that’s transient’?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I see you’ve had a good read of my rubbish.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course. And you shouldn’t contradict people just for the sake of it. As for your saying that everything is hopelessly upside down in my society, it’s the same in present society, but in the opposite sense. Our knowledge &mdash; by which I mean our metaphysical lies, is still in its infancy, while science is a giant … and man, poor suffering creature, has to bear the burden of this dreadful imbalance … on the one hand he knows everything; on the other, nothing. In my society, metaphysical lies, intimate acquaintance with a god of marvels, will be the goal, while everything represented by the science of things &mdash; useless for inner happiness &mdash; will be nothing more than a means of domination in our hands. Don’t let’s argue about that, there’s no point. Man has invented almost everything, but he hasn’t found any guiding principles for government better than the teachings of a Christ or a Buddha. No. Naturally, I won’t question the right to be sceptical about this, but scepticism is a luxury for the minority … we’ll offer the rest a well-cooked happiness, and humanity will gorge itself on this divine pigswill.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You think you can actually bring this off?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer paused for a moment. He twisted the steel ring with the purple stone off his finger and peered inside it; then he leant over towards Barsut, but with a distant look as if his mind was far from the reality he found himself in, and began again:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, everything that man’s mind can imagine is achievable given time. Hasn’t Mussolini already introduced religion into all Italian schools? That’s just one example of how effective the stick across the back is to bring people into line. The essential thing is to capture the soul of a generation … the rest is plain sailing.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about your grand idea?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was coming to that … My plan is to found a secret society that would not only spread my ideas, but serve as a school for future kings of men. I know you’ll say there have been lots of secret societies in the past … and it’s true … they all failed because they weren’t based on solid foundations, they relied on emotion, a political or religious illusion, without taking into account any concrete reality. Our society, on the other hand, will be based on a solid, modern concept: industrialism. In other words, it may have its fantastic side, if that’s how you want to describe what I’ve been talking about, but it will also have industry as its solid foundation, and that is how we will strike gold.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His voice had taken on a sharper edge. A violent spasm gave his face a cross-eyed look. He moved his grizzled head from side to side, as though the pressure of extraordinary emotion was pounding in his brain. He rested his hands on the small of his back, started to pace up and down again, and went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, yes, gold … gold … Do you know what the ancient Germans used to call it? Red gold … gold … D’you follow me? Don’t say a word, Satan. Do you realise that never once has a secret society tried such a combination? Money will be what binds it together, gives the ideas the weight and violence needed to draw people to it. We will aim above all at youngsters, because they are more stupid and more easily carried away. We’ll promise them the kingdom of this world and the triumph of love … we’ll promise them everything … d’you follow me? We’ll give them shiny uniforms, splendid tunics … capes with plumes of every colour … sparkling jewels … different levels of initiation with resounding names, hierarchies … in the mountains we’ll build a cardboard temple, and use it to shoot a film … No. Once we’ve triumphed we’ll build a temple of seven gold doors … it will have pink marble columns and the paths leading to it will be lined with copper shavings. And all around it we’ll create gardens … the whole of mankind will come to adore the living god we’ve invented.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But what about the money for all this … how many millions …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The more the Astrologer spoke, the more his enthusiasm rubbed off on Erdosain. He had forgotten about Barsut, although he was standing right next to him. Despite himself, he conjured up the possibility of a new world. Mankind would live a perpetual happy ritual of simplicity; strontium beams would fill the night sky with showers of red stars, an angel with verdigris wings would perch atop a cloud, while down below men and women dressed in white tunics would glide beneath arches of vegetation, their hearts cleansed of the filth that was choking his. He closed his eyes, and Elsa’s face swam into his memory, but before he could capture its resonance, the Astrologer’s voice boomed out with this ferocious reply:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you want to know where we’ll get the millions from? That’s easy. We’ll organise brothels. The Melancholy Thug will be the Grand Patriarch of the Brothels … every member of the lodge will have a direct interest in all our businesses … we’ll become usurers, we’ll take advantage of women, children, workers, the countryside, madmen. In the mountains … down in Campo Chileno … we’ll pan for gold, we’ll use electricity to help us mine ore. Erdosain has already designed a 500-horsepower turbine. We’ll produce nitric acid by concentrating nitrogen from the atmosphere with a spinning electric arc system; we’ll use hydroelectric power to produce iron, copper and aluminium. D’you follow me? We’ll dupe the workers into going there, and we’ll use the whip to finish off those who refuse to work in the mines. Isn’t that what happens right now in the Gran Chaco, in the tea, rubber and coffee plantations, in the tin mines? We’ll put up an electrified wire fence all round our property, and we’ll buy off all the cops and inspectors of Patagonia with juicy bribes. The thing is to get started. The Gold Prospector’s already here. He found placers of gold when he was travelling through Campo Chileno with a prostitute known as the Mask. We have to get started, that’s all. For the farce of our living god we’ll choose an adolescent … or better still, we could raise an exceptionally beautiful child, educate him to play the role of god. We’ll talk about him … he’ll be talked about everywhere, but with an air of mystery, so that his prestige will grow and grow in people’s minds. Can you imagine what all the fools of Buenos Aires will say when they get wind of the rumour that in the remote mountains of Chubut there’s an adolescent god living in an inaccessible gold and marble temple … a wondrous youth who performs miracles?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Your nonsense is interesting, d’you know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Nonsense? Didn’t people believe in the existence of the plesiosaur a drunken Englishman discovered, the only man in Neuquén the police wouldn’t give a gun licence to because he was such a dreadful shot? … Didn’t people in Buenos Aires believe in the supernatural powers of that Brazilian charlatan who claimed he could cure Orfilia Rico’s paralysis? And if ever there was an unworthy, grotesque spectacle without an ounce of imagination, that was it. Yet didn’t countless idiots weep their eyes out when that trickster held her arm up in triumph, though the girl’s as crippled as ever? It just goes to show that the people of this and every generation have an absolute need to believe in something. And if we can get a newspaper to back us, we can perform miracles. There are lots of them desperate for something sensational like this to sell. And we’ll supply all these people hungry for marvels with a magnificent god, embellished with stories we can copy from the Bible … Now, there’s an idea: we can announce that our youngster is the Messiah the Jews have prophesied … I’ll have to think more about that … we can have photos taken of the god of the jungle … we could make a film with our cardboard temple in the middle of the jungle, and show the god talking to the spirit of the earth.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But are you a complete cynic, or a madman?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain cast a disgusted glance at Barsut. How could he be so stupid and unreceptive to the beauty of the Astrologer’s plans? He thought to himself: “This wild beast is jealous of his magnificent madness. That’s what it is. He’s going to have to be killed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m both. We’ll choose someone in between Krishnamurti and Rudolph Valentino, but more mystical: a child whose strange features symbolise all the world’s suffering. Our films will be shown in the poor districts, in the shanty towns. Can you imagine the impact on the lumpen of the sight of this pale god resurrecting a dead man, or of someone like the archangel Gabriel watching over the gold-mining works, or the metal shipments? Not to mention the alluring prostitutes just waiting to give themselves to the first poor unfortunate who arrives? We’ll be flooded with requests to go and work in the King of the World’s lost city and enjoy the delights of free love … out of all that riff-raff we’ll choose the least educated … and once we’ve got them down there, we’ll thrash all the spirit out of them and force them to work twenty hours a day panning gold.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I thought you were on the side of the workers.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“When I talk to one of them, I’ll be a Red. But now I’m talking to you, and I’m telling you: my secret society is inspired by one organised at the start of the ninth century by a bandit called Abdala-Abn-Maimum. Of course, he didn’t have the industrial element I’m adding to mine, which will guarantee its success. Maimum wanted to bring together the free-thinkers, aristocrats and believers from two such disparate races as the Persians and Arabs in a sect that he built on a hierarchy of initiation and mystery. They told the most barefaced lies to everyone. They promised the Jews the Messiah would come, the Christians the arrival of the Paraclete, the Moslems that of the Mahdi … and they did it to such good effect that a throng of people with widely different opinions, social backgrounds and beliefs, ended up working for an organisation whose real aim was known to only a select few. In this way, Maimum hoped to rule the whole world of Islam. Permit me to tell you that the leaders of the movement were incredible cynics, who believed in absolutely nothing. We’ll follow their example. We’ll be bolsheviks, Catholics, fascists, atheists or militarists, depending on the level of initiation.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re the most shameless swindler I’ve ever met … If it worked …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut felt a strange satisfaction at insulting the Astrologer. The fact was he could not admit he was in any way inferior to him. Moreover, there was something he found deeply humiliating, however absurd it might seem, and that was the shocking fact that Erdosain could have become the close friend of someone of this calibre. He said to himself: “How can it be that this idiot is a friend of someone like him?” That was why he was convinced that he was right always to contradict the Astrologer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It will work, because gold is the lure. The success of our organisation will be judged by the profits our businesses generate. One source of income will be the brothels. Erdosain has invented a machine to enable us to check how many clients each girl has every day. Then there are the donations, and a new industry we’re hoping to launch: manufacturing copper roses, another of Erdosain’s inventions. Perhaps now you can understand why we kidnapped you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What good is that if I’m your prisoner?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At that moment, Erdosain suddenly thought how strange it was that Barsut never once threatened the Astrologer with revenge if he ever managed to get free. This led him to say to himself: “We have to be very careful with this Judas, he’s capable of selling us not for pieces of silver, but out of jealousy.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Your money will enable us to set up a brothel, organise our first expedition and buy tools, install a telegraph office, and whatever else we need for the gold panning.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you won’t admit the possibility of failure?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I will … but I’ll go on as if there were no doubt. Besides, a secret society is like a huge steam engine. The steam it produces can just as easily move a crane as a ventilator.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But what is it you want to move?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A mountain of inert flesh. We, the select few, want &mdash; need &mdash; all the marvellous earthly powers. We’ll consider ourselves fortunate if through our atrocities we can terrorise the weak and arouse the strong. To do that we need to build our own strength, to revolutionise awareness, exalt barbarity. And the immense mysterious power that can set all this in motion is our secret organisation. We’ll bring back the Inquisition, we’ll burn all those who don’t believe in God at the stake. How can it be that people haven’t realised how extraordinarily beautiful it is to burn someone alive? And for not believing in God, d’you get that, for not believing in God! Can’t you see that it’s necessary, absolutely necessary, for a dark, awe-inspiring religion to take hold of men’s hearts once more? For everyone to fall on their knees as a saint passes by, or for the prayers of the humblest of priests to bring about a miracle in the evening sky? Ah, if only you knew how often I’ve dreamt of this! And what gives me hope is knowing how the progress and misery of this century of ours have knocked so many people off balance. And all those eccentrics who can’t find their way in society are so much wasted energy. Put together two simpletons and a cynic in even the most down-and-out local café and you’ve got three geniuses. These geniuses don’t work, they don’t produce anything … I agree with you, they’re no more than tinsel geniuses … but that tinsel represents an energy we can channel into creating the basis for a new and powerful movement. Those are the tools I intend to use.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’ll be a manager of madmen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s it exactly. I want to be a manager of madmen, of all the countless apocryphal geniuses, of all the crazy people who can’t find a place in spiritualist or bolshevik groups … all the lunatics … and I’m telling you this because I have plenty of experience of them … if they’re properly duped, and their passions aroused, they’re capable of doing things that would make your hair stand on end. All the coffee-bar intellectuals. All the backyard inventors, parish prophets, café politicians, the social club philosophers: they’re the ones who’ll be the cannon fodder of our secret society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain smiled. Then, without looking at their chained prisoner, he said: “You’ve no idea how insufferably arrogant all those bordering on genius can be …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, until they’re properly understood, isn’t that right, Barsut?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m not interested.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But you should be, because you’re going to be one of us. This is what I think. Tell one of these borderline people outright that he’s not a genius, and he heaps all the insolence and crassness of someone who’s misunderstood on your head. But if you systematically flatter these self-obsessed monsters, then that same person who would have murdered you at the slightest excuse becomes your willing slave. All you have to do is feed him a grandiose lie in proper doses. Then, inventor or poet, he’ll do all you ask of him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you think you’re a genius too?” growled Barsut.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I do, of course … but only for five minutes a day … though the truth is, it doesn’t bother me that much. Words don’t matter to those born to act. It’s all the borderline people who get puffed up with empty phrases. I have set myself this conundrum, which has nothing to do with my own intellectual capacities: can mankind be happy? And the first people I am approaching for an answer are these malcontents. As a goal, I offer them a lie which will bring them happiness by inflating their vanity … so those same poor devils who, left to their own devices, would be nothing more than objects of pity, will become the precious raw material we use to produce power … steam …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re getting off the point. I was asking what your motives were for wanting to organise this secret society of yours.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s a stupid question. Why did Einstein invent his theory? The world can do without his relativity. How can I know whether or not I’m an instrument in the hands of higher powers, which I don’t believe in at all? I haven’t the faintest idea. The world is a mystery. I may be nothing more than the hand-servant, the slave preparing the perfect abode where the Chosen One, the Saint, will come to die.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut smiled faintly. To hear this man with his cauliflower ear, his unkempt mane of hair and his carpenter’s smock talking of the Chosen One produced a strange sense of contempt in him. How far was this clown putting it all on? But the strangest thing of all was that he was not angry: the feeling the Astrologer produced in him was something else, as if what he was saying were no surprise, as if he had heard it all before, in exactly the same tone of voice, on some remote occasion lost in the dim grey contours of a dream.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer’s tone became less exalted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Believe me, this is what always happens in times of uncertainty and disorientation. A few people somehow foresee that something extraordinary is about to happen … And these people with intuition, this club of seers &mdash; of which I count myself a member &mdash; feel the need to arouse humanity’s awareness … to do something, even if it turns out to be merely ridiculous. In my case, that something is my secret society. Good God! Does anyone have any real idea of the consequences of his actions? When I think I’m about to set in motion a whole world of puppets … puppets that will go forth and multiply … I shudder in terror. It even occurs to me that what might happen is as far removed from what I intend as the disasters committed by an electrician who suddenly goes berserk at his controls are from the wishes of the factory owner. But in spite of that I feel the pressing need to set everything in motion, to bring together the disparate energies of a hundred diverse psychologies, to harmonise them by playing on egotism, vanity, passions and illusions, to make a lie the foundation of this effort, and to make gold its reality … red gold …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All you say is true … you’re bound to succeed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, what do you want from me?” Barsut countered.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I told you before. I want you to sign a cheque for 17,000 pesos. That will leave you 3,000, to do what the hell you like with. We’ll pay you back the rest in monthly instalments out of what we make from the brothels and the gold mining.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And I’ll get out of here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just as soon as we cash the cheque.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What proof do I have you’re telling the truth?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Certain things can’t be proved … but if you want proof, let me simply say that if you refuse to sign the cheque, I’ll have you tortured by the Man Who Saw the Midwife, and once he’s forced you to sign, I’ll kill you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut raised his washed-out eyes; covered in a three-day beard, his face looked as if it were enveloped in a copper mist. Kill him! The words had no effect on him. At that moment, they meant nothing. Besides, life was of so little importance … for a long time he had been expecting some kind of disaster, and now it had happened; but instead of feeling overwhelmed by terror, he discovered in himself an indifference that left him shrugging his shoulders at whatever fate might hold in store. The Astrologer continued:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But I wouldn’t want things to go that far … what I want is for you to help us … for you to take an interest in our projects. Believe me, we’re living in terrible times. The person who can find the lie the masses need will be King of this World. Everyone is a prey to anxiety … no-one is happy with Catholicism, but Buddhism isn’t suited to our temperament, because we’re so corrupted by the need for pleasure. Perhaps we should be talking of Lucifer and the Evening Star. You can add on all the poetry our dreams need, and we can target young people … oh, it’s such a great idea, so great …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer collapsed on to the trunk. The speech had exhausted him. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a rough check handkerchief. The three of them sat in silence for a moment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden Barsut said: “Yes, you’re right, it is a great idea. Untie me, and I’ll sign your cheque for you.” He thought the Astrologer’s speech had been so much hot air, and this almost led to his downfall.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stood up, protesting:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I’ll set you free once we’ve cashed the cheque. Today is Wednesday. You could be free by midday tomorrow, but you’ll only be able to leave our house in two months” &mdash; he was saying this because he realised the other man did not believe in any of his plans &mdash; “Do you need anything this afternoon?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, see you later.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But … you can’t go just like that … stay a while …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No. I’m tired. I need to take a nap. I’ll come back tonight and we can talk some more. Do you want any cigarettes?” “Yes.” The two of them left the stables. Barsut lay down on his bed of hay. He lit a cigarette and blew out some smoke. As it rose, a slanting beam of sunlight picked it out in luminous steel-blue rings. Now he was alone, his thoughts fell neatly into place, and he said to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why not give ‘that fellow’ a helping hand? His plan for a revolutionary camp is interesting, and now I understand why that cretin Erdosain is so taken with him. Of course, it’ll mean I’m out on the street &mdash; maybe so, maybe not … but I always knew it had to come to an end one way or another.” He closed his eyes to muse on the future.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His hat pulled down over his face, the Astrologer turned to Erdosain as they walked along, and said: “Barsut reckons he’s pulling the wool over our eyes. Tomorrow after he signs the cheque we’ll have to kill him …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No: you’ll have to kill him …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s fine by me … we’ve no other choice. Once he were free, he’d turn us in to the police. And he thinks we’re the crazy ones! We would be if we let him live.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They came to a halt close to the house. Up in the blue heavens, the jagged edge of chocolate-coloured clouds pushed rapidly across the sky.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who’s going to do it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Man Who Saw the Midwife.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You know, it’s no easy thing to die with summer just around the corner.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s true enough …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the cheque?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can cash it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Aren’t you afraid I might run off with the money?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Not for the moment, no.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just because. Because you more than anyone need our secret society to succeed &mdash; to save you from boredom. That’s why you’re going along with me in this … out of boredom, and anxiety.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You may be right. What time shall we meet tomorrow?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Let’s see … at nine in the station. I’ll bring you the cheque. By the way, have you got any identity papers?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, nothing can go wrong. Ah, just one thing. I advise you to be brief and calm when you speak in the meeting.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are they all here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Gold Prospector as well?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two men pushed their way through the branches and made for the summer-house. This was an open construction of latticed wood, into which shoots from a honeysuckle bush pushed their purple and white clusters.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-71" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-28" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897201309168" class="calibre10"></a>
     THE FARCE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">As the two of them entered, the circle of men inside stood up. Erdosain halted in amazement when he saw that one was an army officer in a major’s uniform.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Apart from the Major, the Gold Prospector, Haffner, and someone he did not know were also present. Haffner had his elbows on a table, and was scanning some scribbled sheets of paper, while the Gold Prospector pored over a map opposite him. A rough stone placed on top of the sheet stopped the breeze blowing it away. The Thug shook Erdosain’s hand, and he sat down next to him, still staring at the Major, who had immediately aroused his curiosity. The Astrologer certainly was a master of surprises.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Yet the newcomer did not give him a favourable impression. He was a tall, pale-faced man with jet-black eyes. What disturbed Erdosain was the way his lower lip seemed constantly curled in a disdainful sneer, and the three creases where his long, hooked nose met his forehead. A silken moustache covered his red lips, and after being introduced he scarcely seemed to give Erdosain more than a cursory glance before he sank down on to a hammock, leaning back against a post with his sword between his knees and a lock of hair plastered to his flat forehead.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">For a few minutes, none of them spoke, as they observed each other uneasily. Sitting close to the entrance to the summer-house, the Astrologer lit a cigarette and weighed up the men he was to call his “chiefs”. All at once he lifted his head and, taking in the five men sitting round the table, began to speak:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t see any point in repeating what we all know already and have agreed on in individual meetings … that is, the plan to organise a secret society to be paid for out of both moral and immoral ventures. We are all in agreement on that, aren’t we? What do you think (I have a liking for geometry) if we call the groups of our society ‘cells’?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what they’re called in Russia,” said the Major. “And those in any one cell should not know the members of any other.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What … the leaders wouldn’t know each other?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, the ones who would not know each other are not the leaders, but the members.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector butted in:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That would make things impossible. If that’s so, what links the members of the different cells?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But it’s the six of us who are the links of the society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, sir … it’s me who is the society,” the Astrologer objected. “But to be serious, I would say that all the members make up the society … apart from a few restrictions concerning myself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major wanted his say:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I think this discussion is pointless, because as I see it there will be a perfectly well worked-out system of promotion. And each promotion will bring a cell member into contact with a new leader. There will be as many promotions as there are cell leaders.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How many cells are there at the moment anyway?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Four. I’ll be in overall charge,” the Astrologer went on: “You, Erdosain, will be our Industrial Chief; the Gold Prospector” &mdash; a young man sitting at the corner of the table nodded in acknowledgement &mdash; “will be in charge of our camps and mining operations; the Major here will be responsible for spreading our society in the army; and Haffner will be the Chief of Brothels.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner stood up to protest:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I beg your pardon, but I’m not going to be chief of anything. The fact that I’m here has no special significance. I’m simply doing you a favour by drawing up a budget for the brothels. If you’re not happy with that, I’ll leave.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, stay,” the Astrologer apologised. The Melancholy Thug sat down and went back to doodling with a pencil. Erdosain could not help admiring his arrogance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There was no doubt however that it was the Major who was the centre of everyone’s attention, due to the prestige of his uniform and the remarkable fact of his being there at all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector turned to him: “So what brings you here? Are you hoping to spread our secret society among the army?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Everyone sat upright in their chairs. This was the big surprise of their meeting, the <em class="calibre11">coup de théatre</em> planned in silence. Beyond a shadow of doubt, the Astrologer had what it took to be a leader. The only shame was that he kept the workings of his mind such a secret. But Erdosain felt proud to be associated with him. Everyone was leaning forward in their seats to hear what the Major had to say. The Major studied the Astrologer’s face, then began:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen, I have carefully weighed what I am about to say. Otherwise I would not be here. This is the position: our army is full of disgruntled officers. There is no point going over the reasons for this; they would be of no interest to you. Ideas of a ‘dictatorship’ and the recent political and military events in both Spain and Chile have led many of my colleagues to think that our country might also be fertile ground for such a dictatorship.” His listeners’ jaws dropped in utter astonishment. What they were hearing was completely unexpected.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector wanted to know:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you think then that the Argentine army … I mean, its officers, would be open to our ideas?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course they would … provided you can present them properly. I can tell you from the outset that far more officers than you would think possible are fed up with democratic theories, parliament included. No, don’t interrupt me. Ninety per cent of the parliamentarians in our country could not match an army lieutenant in terms of education and culture. Accused of participating in the murder of a governor, one politician hit the nail on the head when he replied: ‘to govern a nation requires no more skills than those of a ranch foreman.’ What he said is true of all Latin America.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer sat rubbing his hands with obvious glee.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major looked at each of them, then went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The army is a superior state within an inferior society, since by definition we are the country’s strength. And yet we are subject to the government’s resolutions … but what exactly is the government? … the legislative and executive powers … in other words, people chosen by rag-tag political parties … and what representatives they are, my friends! You know better than I that to get into parliament you need to have made a career of lying, starting out as a malingerer in committees, then doing deals and communing with shysters of every description: in short, a life beyond the bounds of the law and the truth. I’ve no idea if the same happens in more civilised countries, but that’s the way it is here. In our congress and senate there are members accused of usury and murder, rogues in the pay of foreign companies &mdash; people of such crass ignorance that the parliamentary system here is the most grotesque farce ever to have sullied the life of a nation. The presidential elections are funded by United States capital, on the basis of promises to grant concessions to firms which want to exploit our national riches. I am not exaggerating when I say that in this country of ours, the contest between the political parties is no more than a squabble between salesmen vying to sell the nation to the highest bidder.”<sup class="calibre15">2</sup></div>
    <div class="paragraph">They all sat gaping open-mouthed at the Major. Beyond the wooden lattices and the clusters of honeysuckle the morning sky was a bright blue, but not one of them noticed. Later, Erdosain confided in me that none of those present at that Wednesday meeting had been expecting anything half so sensational. The Major dabbed his lips with a handkerchief and went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m glad my words have struck a chord. There are a lot of young officers who think as I do, and even some recently appointed generals … what you must do &mdash; and don’t be surprised by what I am about to say &mdash; is to give the society a completely communist slant. I’m saying this because there’s no such thing as communism in Argentina &mdash; I wouldn’t describe a bunch of carpenters talking sociological nonsense in some hall where nobody takes their hats off as communists. I’d like to explain my ideas to you as clearly as possible. Every secret society is like a cancer in the community. Its mysterious processes upset the proper functioning of its host. Well … we cell leaders must make sure that those processes are entirely bolshevik” &mdash; this was the first time that the word had been uttered in the meeting, and despite themselves, everyone glanced at each other nervously &mdash; “This will attract a lot of crackpots, and help the cells proliferate. That way we can create a fictitious revolutionary force. We’ll specialise in terrorist attacks. Even a half-successful one brings out all the dark, ferocious forces in society. If we repeat the attacks over a year, accompanying them with anti-social leaflets inciting the proletariat to set up ‘soviets’ … do you know what we will have achieved? Something as striking as it is simple. We’ll have created a state of revolutionary agitation.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’d define this ‘revolutionary agitation’ as a kind of collective unrest, incapable of finding its true goal: everyone is on edge, their passions aroused; the newspapers stir things up still further, and the police add their bit by arresting innocent people who become revolutionaries after all they suffer at their hands; everyone wakes up in the morning anxious for the latest news, hoping to hear of an even more terrifying act of terror than before, which would confirm their worst suspicions; police brutality only further inflames the anger of those who suffer it, until some hot-head empties his pistol into a cop’s chest. The workers’ organisations start to react and declare strikes; the words ‘revolution’ and ‘bolshevism’ spread fear and hope everywhere. Then, when a whole series of bombs have gone off all over the city, when all the leaflets have been read, and the revolutionary agitation has reached its peak, that’s the moment for us military people to step in …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major moved his boots out of a shaft of sunlight and went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, we military people will step in. We will say that in view of the government’s evident inability to defend the institutions of the fatherland, business or the family, we are taking over the state, and declaring a temporary dictatorship. All dictatorships are by definition temporary: that helps boost confidence. Bourgeois capitalists, and above all, right-wing foreign governments will immediately recognise the new regime. We will blame the ‘soviets’ for forcing us to act this way, and shoot a few poor devils who have been caught and have confessed to making bombs. We will close both houses of parliament, and reduce state spending to a minimum. Administration of the state will be in the hands of the military. In this way, Argentina will achieve an unheard-of grandeur.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major fell silent. Everyone in the flowery summer-house burst into applause. A pigeon flew off.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Your idea is fabulous,” said Erdosain, “but it means we’d all be working for you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Didn’t you want to be leaders?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but all we’ll get will be the crumbs from the feast.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, sir, you’re mistaken … the idea is …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer cut in:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen … we haven’t come here to discuss the future direction of our organisation, but to plan the activities of each cell leader. If you agree, we can get started.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A good-looking young man who had not said a word until now raised his voice: “D’you mind if I say something?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, of course not …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, I think the first thing to sort out is: do you want to bring about a revolution or not? The organisational details can wait till later.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right, they come later … yes, you’re right.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The stranger finally explained who he was.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m a friend of Haffner’s. A lawyer. I’ve given up the benefits my profession could offer me because I wanted no truck with the capitalist system. Do I have the right to say what I think?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course you do.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well then, I think that what the Major has said changes the whole direction of our society.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No,” the Gold Prospector objected. “It could be its starting point, without affecting any of the other principles.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The discussion was about to start up again. The Astrologer got to his feet:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Gentlemen, leave the debate for another day. What concerns us now is not ideas, but the commercial organisation of our group. I therefore propose we leave out anything not directly related to that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But that’s dictatorship,” the lawyer burst out. The Astrologer stared him in the eye for a moment, then said pointedly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It seems to me you see yourself as a born leader … and I think you’re right. If you’re smart, you should set about organising another society separate from ours. That way, we can both help bring about the collapse of the present system. But here, either you obey me, or you leave.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two men faced each other for a few moments; then the lawyer stood up, stared at the Astrologer one last time, nodded a hard man’s smile and walked out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The ensuing silence was finally broken by the Major’s voice. He said to the Astrologer: “You were quite right to act as you did. Discipline is fundamental to everything. We’re listening.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Diamond-shaped patches of sun threw their golden mosaic on to the summer-house’s black earthen floor. The sound of an anvil could be heard from a distant blacksmith’s; in the branches of the trees countless birds began to warble. Erdosain was chewing on a white honeysuckle flower, while the Gold Prospector sat with elbows on knees, staring at the floor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Thug was smoking; Erdosain examined the Astrologer’s mongoloid features, his grey smock buttoned to the neck.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An awkward silence followed the Major’s words: what did this intruder want from them? Suddenly annoyed, Erdosain stood up and protested:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There can be as much discipline as you like in this, but it’s absurd to be talking about a military dictatorship. All we are interested in is for the armed forces to join our revolutionary movement.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major sat upright in his chair and smiled at Erdosain:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you admit I played my role well?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Role?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s right … I’m as much a Major as you are.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do you see how powerful a lie can be?” said the Astrologer. “I disguised my friend here as an officer, and that &mdash; despite the fact that you’re pretty much in on the secret &mdash; was enough for you all to believe there would be a revolution in the army.”<sup class="calibre15">3</sup></div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So what?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, this was nothing more than a rehearsal, but some day we’ll act out the drama for real.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer’s words were so chilling that the four other men sat watching the Major, who now said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In fact, I never got any higher than a sergeant” &mdash; but the Astrologer cut short his explanation by saying:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about you, Haffner, do you have the proposed budget?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … here it is.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer leafed through the figures scrawled on several sheets of paper, then explained to his audience: “The brothels are the surest way our secret society has of making money.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Our friend here has given me a budget for the installation of a brothel with ten girls. This is a list of the costs:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ten second-hand sets of bedroom furniture</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$2,000</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Monthly rent</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$400</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Three months’ deposit</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$1,200</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Installation of kitchen, bathrooms, bar</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$2,000</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Monthly pay-off to police inspector</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$300</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Pay-off to doctor</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$150</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Pay-off to local politician for licence</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$2,000</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Monthly local taxes</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$50</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Electric piano</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$1,500</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Manageress</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$150</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Cook</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$150</div>
    <div class="paragraph">TOTAL</div>
    <div class="paragraph">$9,900</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Each girl will put in fourteen pesos a week for her food, and will have to buy all the tea, sugar, kerosene, candles, stockings, powders, soap and perfumes that she needs from the establishment.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer was in his stride:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Over and above our expenses, we can count on a minimum income of 2,500 pesos a month. That means we’ll have recovered the capital invested within four months. With half of the money we make we’ll set up other brothels, we’ll use a quarter of it to pay off our debts, and the rest can be used to support our revolutionary cells. Does everyone approve the expenditure of 10,000 pesos?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Everybody nodded, except for the Gold Prospector, who asked: “Who’ll be the accountant?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We can choose him once everything is set up.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All right then.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you with us too, Major?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked up and examined the false officer’s pallid face, as he stared with shifty eyes at a white butterfly fluttering on a patch of green. Erdosain could not help wondering how on earth the Astrologer found creatures like him to join his schemes. It seemed the Astrologer had read his thoughts:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about you, Erdosain, how much will you need to set up your galvano-plastics laboratory?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A thousand pesos.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, so you’re the inventor of the copper rose, are you?” the Major asked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Congratulations. I think it will be a great success. Of course, you’ll have to galvanise the flowers on a large scale.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right. I’d thought of doing photography in the same laboratory, to save on the costs.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s for you to decide.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s also a trained friend of mine who can help with the galvano-plastics” &mdash; when he said that, Erdosain was thinking of the Espila family, who were also possible candidates for the secret society &mdash; but the Astrologer interrupted his thoughts by announcing:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now the Gold Prospector will give us news of the region where we’re thinking of setting up our camp.” At this, the other man stood up. Erdosain was amazed by his appearance. According to the idea the cinema had given him of this kind of character, he had imagined a giant of a man with a bushy blond beard, who stank of drink. The reality was very different.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector was a young man of about his own age, with a very pale skin drawn tightly over flat cheekbones, and lively jet-black eyes. By contrast, his enormous barrel chest seemed to belong to someone twice his size. He had spindly bow legs. A revolver butt stuck out between his leather belt and his trousers. His voice was level and clear, but everything about him was ill-assorted, as if he had been put together from bits and pieces which belonged to different kinds of men. His face was that of a cardsharp, used to squinting at his hand; he had a boxer’s chest and the legs of a jockey. And his past was just as odd a jumble as his physique. Up to the age of fourteen he had lived in the countryside, until he killed a thief, and then years later fear of tuberculosis also sent him back to the pampas, where he had spent days and nights galloping incredible distances. Erdosain took an immediate liking to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector unwrapped some rocks. They were chunks of gold-bearing quartz. He said gravely: “And I have with me the analysis certificate from the Department of Mines.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The stones passed quickly from hand to hand. They all feasted their eyes on them greedily, as their fingers gently stroked the flakes and veins of gold in the quartz. The Astrologer slowly rolled himself a cigarette, all the while observing their faces as the shock of what they were seeing sank in, and temptation gripped their features. The Gold Prospector sat down again and said to them all nonchalantly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There is a lot of gold down there which nobody knows about. It’s near Campo Chileno. At first I was in Esquel … in the abandoned workings of a mine … then I went on to Arroyo Pescado … I walked and walked … I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but down there you can travel for days on end without seeming to get anywhere. Anyway, finally I reached Campo Chileno. It’s forest, pure forest for thousands of square kilometres. I was there with the Mask, a prostitute from Esquel who knew a way in because she had been there before with a miner who got killed when they returned to town. People down there kill each other for no reason at all. The Mask was riddled with syphilis and didn’t make it out of the woods. How well I remember her! She had been roaming around down there for more than twenty years. From Puerto Madryn she went to Comodoro, and from there to Trelew, and then Esquel. She knew absolutely all the gold prospectors. First the two of us headed for Arroyo Pescado … that’s forty leagues south of Esquel … but all I found were a few traces of alluvial gold … then we travelled for two weeks through the hills on horseback until we reached Campo Chileno.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector narrated all his adventures, his voice cool and steady as he concentrated on the details of his southern odyssey. Listening intently, Erdosain found himself transported into the company of the Mask, crossing immense ravines in the cold and dark, with the purple triangular mass of mountain upon mountain filling the horizon. Then the peaks disappeared as they entered eternal forests of trees with red trunks and dark green foliage; they pushed ever onwards, numbed by the vast smooth expanses of sky like a desert of blue ice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Oblivious to the astonishment his words had caused, the Gold Prospector went on with the story of his months of adventure, only occasionally gesturing to emphasise a point. All the others were listening with rapt attention.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Finally, one morning, I reached the black gulch. This was a circle of jagged black basalt rocks, a deep well crested with dark stalagmites, high above which the blue of the sky seemed infinitely sad. A few lone birds strayed over the stone crags that lay in the shadow of even higher peaks … and at the bottom of this hollow was a lake of golden water fed by the silver rivulets of waterfalls that threaded their way down through the undergrowth.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector had never before been in such sinister surroundings. Astonished, he halted to gaze at the bronze depths of the lake reflecting the black jutting rocks above. Speckled with green stains and long streaks of malachite, the rock walls fell sheer into the water, in which also shone his pale, bearded face with the immense sky behind it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Although from its colour the Gold Prospector immediately suspected the water might be full of gold, he dismissed the idea as absurd, because he had never read or heard of anything of the sort. He went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But after I got out of the forest, I was in Rawson one day in a dentist’s waiting-room, and I started to leaf through a copy of a magazine called ‘Medical Weekly’ that I saw on one of the tables there. It was then I made the discovery. I opened the magazine at random, and on the first page I came to, I found an article called: ‘Gold water, or colloidal gold in the treatment of lupus erythematosus’. I started to read it, and discovered that gold can be suspended in water in microscopic particles … and that what was a new phenomenon for me had in fact been discovered by the alchemists, who had called it ‘gold water’. They obtained it by the simplest method imaginable: plunging a white-hot piece of gold into rainwater. I immediately remembered the lake, which I had thought was that colour because of the vegetation in it. Without realising it, I had been standing beside a lake of colloidal gold, formed over countless centuries as water from the cascades passed over veins in the rocks. See what ignorance does for you? If chance had not put that magazine article in my hands, I would never have known the importance of my discovery.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So did you go back there?” the Major wanted to know.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Naturally. I went back only eight months ago, when I wrote to the Astrologer … but I made a mistake … I have to study how to extract the gold … it’s all in seams there … we’d have to work hard, and get divers’ suits, because it’s the lake bottom that is golden, the water itself is colourless.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner said: “What you say is fascinating. Even if there’s no gold, it sounds better than this lousy city.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major added: “If we set up a camp in Campo Chileno, we’ll need a telegraph office.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain replied: “If that’s so, we can install a portable facility with a wavelength of between forty-five and eighty metres. It would cost 500 pesos and have a range of 3,000 kilometres.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major spoke once more: “I’m particularly in favour of the camp because we could set up our poison gas factory there. I believe you know something about that, Erdosain.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, for example mustard gas can be made by electrolysis, though I haven’t studied the matter in any depth &mdash; but you’re right, the gases and the germ laboratory are what we need to concentrate on. Especially the lab for producing the bubonic plague and Asiatic cholera. We need to get hold of some proper bacteria specimens, because the actual production is extremely cheap.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer interrupted them:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I think it would be best to leave the organisation of the camp until later. For now, we should concentrate on getting Haffner’s project underway. We can only organise the first group to leave for the colony once we are making some money. Was there a family you had in mind, Erdosain?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, the Espilas.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner butted in:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Hold on a minute! I reckon all this is just so much hot air. I’m nothing more than a collaborator in your secret society, but I reckon we have to sort something out right now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stared at him and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you willing to put up the money to get us started? No. Well then? Wait until we have some funds, which should be in a matter of days, and then you’ll see.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Haffner stood up and, looking over at the Gold Prospector, said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Listen, friend: once the camp idea is settled, let me know; and if you need people, so much the better; I’ll supply you with a gang of lay-abouts who would be delighted to get out of Buenos Aires” &mdash; so saying, he put on his hat and was about to leave without shaking hands with anyone, until he suddenly remembered something and shouted to the Astrologer: “If you hurry up and get the money, there’s a great brothel for sale. It’s got a grill attached to it, and it’s a good place for gambling too. The boss is Uruguayan; he’s asking 15,000 cash, but he’d settle for 10,000 now and the other 5,000 in a year.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Could you come here on Friday?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, let’s meet on Friday, and I think we can do a deal.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“’Bye,” was all the Thug said, and left.</div>

     THE GOLD PROSPECTOR <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Once Haffner had gone, Erdosain, who wanted to talk to the Gold Prospector, also said goodbye to the Astrologer and the Major. He was feeling uneasy again. As he was about to leave, the Astrologer whispered to him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Be sure you’re here at nine tomorrow; we have to cash the cheque.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had forgotten about “that”. He glanced all around him as if stunned by a blow. He needed to talk to someone; to forget the dark obligation he was under that made his heart beat faster in the hot midday sun.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He had taken a liking to the Gold Prospector. He went over to him and asked: “Shall we leave together? I’d like to talk to you about ‘down there’.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The other man studied him with his glittering eyes, then said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, I’d be delighted. You seem an interesting guy.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Thanks.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Especially from what the Astrologer has told me about you. You know that’s a great plan of yours to bring about the revolution using plague germs?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked up. He felt embarrassed by so much praise. Could it really be that someone took the nonsense he dreamt up seriously?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector insisted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That and the poison gases are a stroke of genius. Can you imagine? To leave a canister in Police Headquarters just when that monster Santiago is there! To poison all the cops like rats!” He gave such a loud snorting laugh that three birds flew up in unison from the branches of a lemon tree. “Yes, Erdosain my friend, you’re something special. Plagues and chlorine! We’re going to make the revolution here in this city. I can just see the day &mdash; all the shopkeepers poking their scared snouts out of their holes like weasels, while we cleanse the world of all that garbage with our machine guns. You can buy a fine machine gun for 1,000 pesos. Two hundred and fifty rounds a minute. A real treasure! Then we’ll lay down clouds of chlorine and mustard gas … Oh, you should publish your ideas in the papers, believe me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain interrupted this string of extravagant praise to ask:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you found gold, did you? Gold …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I take it you didn’t swallow a word of that tale about ‘gold water’?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What d’you mean, tale? So the gold …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It exists, of course it does … it’s just a question of finding it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked so crestfallen that the Gold Prospector hastily added: “Look here … I told you that because the Astrologer said I could count on you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but I thought …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That amongst all the lies, that was one of the few truths …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It is true in essence. The gold does exist … we simply have to find it. You should be happy that everything is being organised to go in search of it. Or do you reckon that those numbskulls would move an inch if they weren’t driven on by magnificent lies? I’ve given it so much thought! That’s why the Astrologer’s theory is such a stroke of genius: men only respond to lies. He gives lies the consistency of truth; people who would never have so much as budged to get anything, guys who have become totally cynical and desperate, come to life again in the truth of his lies. Can you imagine anything more sublime? Why, exactly the same thing happens all the time, and nobody protests. Yes, everything is a sham, if we only think about it … there’s no-one who wouldn’t admit that our society is run on niggardly, stupid lies. So what great sin is the Astrologer committing? He’s simply exchanging a trifling lie for one that’s eloquent, enormous, transcendental. With his falsehoods, the Astrologer seems extraordinary to us, but he’s no such thing … or rather, he is, he is … because he’s not after personal gain from his lies; yet he’s not, because all he’s doing is applying an age-old principle that every swindler and social dreamer has always used. If one day his life story gets written, those who read it with any sense of judgement will say: he was great because the methods he employed to achieve his ideals were those available to any charlatan. And what we see as extraordinary and disturbing is simply the fear of weak, uninspired minds who believe success only comes from complicated and mysterious processes rather than from anything simple. And yet you know as well as I do that the greatest gestures are the simplest, like Columbus and his egg.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The truth of lies?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Exactly. The problem is we aren’t bold enough for these great schemes. We imagine it must be more difficult to run a state than a simple house; we put too much literature, too much stupid romanticism into things.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But deep down d’you feel … I mean, do you get the impression that we’re going to succeed?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Totally, and believe me … we’re going to be rulers of Argentina … if not the world. It must be. The Astrologer’s plan is a salvation for mankind worn out as it is by the mechanisation of our civilisation. There are no ideas any more. No good or bad symbols. I once heard the Astrologer talking about the colonies set up in the ancient world by all the misfits who did not feel at home in their own countries. We’ll do the same, but we’ll make our society something like a rowdy game … a game that wins over even thc souls of shopkeepers who like to go to watch cowboy movies. Oh, you can’t imagine all the mischief we’ll make! As a last resort we could spread nitroglycerine bombs just to laugh at the panic they cause among the rabble. What d’you think the hellraisers and neighbourhood gangs were in their day? Youngsters who had no other way to channel their energies. So they worked it off beating up some stuck-up gent or an Arab. Just think … Comodoro … Puerto Madryn, Trelew, Esquel, Arroyo Pescado, Campo Chileno, I know all the trails and all the badlands … Believe me … we’ll create a marvellous band of youth” &mdash; he was getting carried away &mdash; “Don’t you believe there is any gold? You’re like those kids at table whose eyes are bigger than their stomachs. Everything in this country of ours is gold.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain could feel himself being swept along by the other man’s enthusiasm. The Gold Prospector talked in great gulps, his eyes twitching as he lifted first one eyebrow then the other, and he kept pumping Erdosain’s arm in a friendly way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Believe me, Erdosain … there’s a lot of gold … more than you could even dream of … but that’s not the point. The point is this: time is slipping by. Esquel, Arroyo Pescado, Rio Pico … Campo Chileno … league upon league … travelling for day after day … and as you know, just to get a certificate for a horse not even worth ten pesos you have to travel for weeks: time is meaningless … everything is huge … enormous … eternal down there. You have to believe it. I remember when the Mask and I were down near Arroyo Pescado. Not just gold … red gold. That’s where souls made sick by civilisation can be cured. We should send all our friends to the mountains. Look … I’m twenty-seven … and I’ve risked my life with a pistol several times” &mdash; so saying, he drew out his revolver &mdash; “See that sparrow over there?” &mdash; it was about fifty paces away &mdash; he raised his gun level with his chin, pulled the trigger, and as the shot rang out, the bird fell out of the tree. “See that? That’s how I’ve risked my life time and again. There’s no reason to be sad. Look, I’m twenty-seven now. Arroyo Pescado, Esquel, Rio Pico, Campo Chileno … all those vast empty spaces can be ours … we can organise the escort for a New Joy … the Order of the Knights of Red Gold … You think I’m getting carried away. No! You have to have been down there to understand. It’s the kind of experience that makes you aware that what’s needed more than anything else is a natural aristocracy. When you’re up against solitude, all the dangers, sadness, the sun, the infinite empty plains, you become a new man … completely different from the herd of slaves eking out an existence in the city. Do you know what the anarchist, the socialist proletariat of our cities really is? Nothing more than a herd of cowards. Instead of going to put their souls to the test in the mountains or the empty plains, they prefer comfort and entertainment; they don’t want to know about the heroic solitude of the wilderness. What would become of all the factories, the fashion houses, the city’s thousand parasites, if everyone left for the wilderness … if everyone set up their own tent down there? D’you understand now why I am with the Astrologer? It’s up to us young people to create this new life. We’ll set up a bandit aristocracy. We’ll shoot all the intellectuals infected with Tolstoy’s idiotic ideas, and put the rest to work for us. That’s why I admire Mussolini. He used a stick across the back of all those mandolin players, and from one day to the next that comic-opera kingdom was transformed into the mastiff of the Mediterranean. Cities are the world’s cancer. They destroy men; they make them cowards who are sly and envious &mdash; and it’s envy that makes them assert their rights, envy and cowardice. If those herds had any noble, courageous beasts among them, they would have smashed everything to bits long before now. To believe in the masses is to believe you can reach out and bring down the moon. Look what happened to Lenin with the Russian peasants. But everything has been organised now, and all that’s left to say is: in this century, anyone who does not feel at home in the city should head out for the wilderness. That’s what the Astrologer is suggesting. And he’s right. When the first Christians could not bear life in the cities, they went into the desert. There they found their own kind of happiness. Nowadays though, the lumpen prefers to bray in committees.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You know something? I like your comparison with the desert.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right, Erdosain. As the Astrologer says: those who don’t fit in in the cities shouldn’t spoil it for those who do. For the unhappy and the misfits there are the mountains, the plains, the banks of the great rivers.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had not expected such a passionate outburst. The Gold Prospector seemed to read his mind, because he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We will preach violence, but we won’t allow any theorists of violence in our cells: anyone who wants to show his hatred of present society will first have to give us proof of his loyalty. Can you see now what the point of the training camp is? Isn’t gold another wonderful illusion? Anyone wanting to join must sacrifice himself for us. The effort will make a superman of him. And that’s when he will be given power. Isn’t that what happens in monastic orders? Isn’t that the way the army is organised? No, don’t gawp at me like that! Even in big stores, like Gath &amp; Chaves or Harrods, employees have told me the staff accept a level of discipline that makes the army look like a joke in comparison. So you can see, Erdosain, we’re not inventing a thing. All we’re doing is exchanging a banal goal for an extraordinary one.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector made Erdosain feel ashamed. He envied him his violence; he was irritated by his sweeping, incontrovertible truths, and wanted above all to be able to contradict him. But he said to himself: “I am not cut out for a starring role like him, I’m one of those miserable cowards who live in the city. Why can’t I feel his fervour and loathing? Yes, what he says is true. And I just smile politely at him, as if I was afraid he’d beat me up, and it’s true his violence does frighten me, I am scared by his passion.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What are you thinking, pal?” the Gold Prospector said.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked at him long and hard, then said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was thinking how sad it is to have been brought up a coward.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Gold Prospector shrugged.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You reckon you’re a coward because the life you’ve lived has never forced you to risk your hide. I’d like to see you the day your life depends on pulling a trigger, then I’d know whether you were one or not. The thing is no-one in the city can be brave. You know very well that if you punch some wretch the police are going to hound you so much that you prefer to be tolerant rather than take justice into your own hands. That’s the way things are. So you get used to accepting everything, to checking your impulses …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked at him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re remarkable, you know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t worry, pal. You’ll see how you yourself wake up soon enough … you’ll find your courageous side … all you need is to take the first step.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was one in the afternoon when the two men parted company.</div>

     THE CRIPPLE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">That same day, just as Erdosain reached the last flight of the spiral staircase up to his room, he saw a woman dressed in an otter fur coat and a green hat talking to his landlady on the landing. A “here he comes” told him he was the person they were waiting for, and as he halted in front of them, the stranger turned her lightly freckled face towards him and asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you señor Erdosain?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where have I seen that face before?” Erdosain wondered, answering that indeed he was. The woman then presented herself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m señor Ergueta’s wife.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, so you’re the Cripple, are you?” he said, then ashamed at his rudeness, which had even led the astonished landlady to stare at the other woman’s feet, Erdosain apologised:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m sorry, you took me by surprise … you must understand I wasn’t expecting … won’t you come in?” Before opening the door, Erdosain apologised for the state she would find it in, but Hipólita merely gave a wry smile and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s no problem.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt irritated by the cold look filtering from her light verdigris eyes, and he thought to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s something perverse about her” &mdash; he had noticed that underneath her green hat, Hipólita’s red hair fell in two smooth bands covering the tips of her ears. He looked again at her fine red eyelashes, at her plump lips that looked out of place in the pink softness of her freckled face. “How different from that photo of hers!” Erdosain thought.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Standing at his side, she looked at him as if to say: “So this is the man.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Next to her, he could sense her presence without really taking it in, as if she did not really exist, or was miles away from his thoughts. Yet there she was, and he had to say something; so after switching the light on and offering her a seat while he sat on the sofa, he managed to get out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you are Ergueta’s wife? Fancy that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He still could not work out what this new being was doing suddenly flung into the midst of his disarray. A spurt of curiosity swept through his mind, but he would have liked the situation to be different, to feel he really knew this woman’s face, its oval curves giving off a coppery sheen, the violet lashes seeming to diffuse her gaze like the rays of watery sun radiating in a thousand beams out of a pinnacle of clouds behind a saint’s head in a popular print.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was thinking: “My body is here, but where is my soul?” &mdash; and he repeated: “So you are Ergueta’s wife? Fancy that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita crossed her legs and smoothed the hem of her dress well below her knees, the material rustling in her rosy fingers. She raised her head slowly, as if this cost her a great effort in the strange surroundings of an unknown room, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You have to do something for my husband. He’s gone mad.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s no great surprise to me,” Erdosain reflected, and, pleased he could remain cool and collected &mdash; like one of those bankers in the novels of Xavier de Montepin &mdash; he replied, easing into the role he had invented for himself: “So he’s gone mad, has he?” Then all of a sudden, realising he could not keep up the pretence any longer, he burst out with: “D’you know something? You give me this extraordinary news, and yet it leaves me cold. It hurts me to be this way, empty of all emotion; I want to feel something, and yet I’m like a fence-post. You must forgive me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. You will forgive me, won’t you? I wasn’t always like this. I can remember I used to be as happy as a lark. Bit by bit, I’ve changed. I can’t explain: I see you, I’d like to feel I’m your friend, but it’s impossible. If you were dying here now in front of me, I doubt I’d even offer you a glass of water. D’you understand? And yet … Anyway, where is he?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“In Las Mercedes asylum.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s odd. Didn’t you live in Azul?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but we’ve been here a fortnight …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“When did it happen?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Six days ago. I can’t understand it. It’s like you said before. Forgive me if I’m wasting your time. I thought of you because you knew him, and he was always talking about you. When was the last time you saw him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“When you got married … Yes, he told me about you. He called you the Cripple … and the harlot.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt Hipólita’s soul wash his eyes with a gentle glaze. He was sure he could talk to her about anything. The woman’s soul was curled up there, ready and willing to receive him. As she spoke, her hands were clasped on her lap, and this relaxed position helped increase his sense of ease. That morning’s events at the Astrologer’s seemed far away: the only memories he had were of a fragment of tree and of sky, and as these fleeting images passed through his mind, they left a glowing, unwarranted sense of pleasure. He rubbed his hands together with satisfaction, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t take offence … but I think he was already crazy when he married you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me … d’you know if he used to gamble before we were married?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … and I remember he studied the Bible, because he talked about a new age dawning, about the fourth seal, and a whole lot of other things as well. And yes, he gambled. He always interested me because I took him to be a typical hysteric.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right. A hysteric. He once even staked 5,000 pesos on a poker game. He sold my jewels, a necklace a friend had given me …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that? … Didn’t you give that necklace to your maid just before your marriage? That’s what he told me. That you gave her the necklace and your silver service … and the cheque for 10,000 pesos that other man gave you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you think I’m mad too? … Why on earth would I give my maid a pearl necklace?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He lied, then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So it seems.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How strange! …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t be so amazed. He lied a lot. Anyway, he was in another world recently. He had studied a combination he could apply to roulette. You would have laughed to see him. He wrote out a whole bookful of numbers only he could understand. What a man! He was so worried he couldn’t sleep. He left the pharmacy unattended; sometimes when the light was already out in the bedroom and I was about to go to sleep, I would hear a loud thump on the floor: it was him &mdash; he’d leapt out of bed and was feverishly scribbling numbers as if afraid they might escape him … So he told you I’d given away my pearl necklace, did he? What a man! It was he who pawned it before our marriage … Well, as I was saying … last month he went to the Real Casino in San Carlos …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And he lost, of course …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, he turned 700 pesos into 7,000. You should have seen the state he arrived in … not a word … I said to myself: ‘That’s it, he’s lost’ … but the remarkable thing is how scared he was at his own good luck … until then, he’d been quite sceptical about the combination …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … I understand … he preferred to believe in it than to put it to the test.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right, he was afraid of failing. But as I was saying … for several days he was in another world. I remember that once during our siesta he turned to me and said: ‘Well, my lady, it looks like you’ll have to get used to being Queen of the World.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Exaggerating as usual.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I must confess that after his success, even I was tempted to believe in his combination. The first time around he’d strictly followed the numbers in it, so now he withdrew 3,000 pesos from my account to break the bank with, plus the other 6,500 &mdash; he’d used the rest to pay some debts from the pharmacy &mdash; and off we went to Montevideo. He lost every cent.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How long did it take?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Twenty minutes … I thought he was going to pass out on the way back … but, did he really tell you I had given my necklace to the maid? What a man!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was probably to give me a good impression of you. What was the journey back like?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All right … he didn’t say a word. His eyes were glazed over though, and his face was terrible, all puffy and shapeless. As soon as we got back to Buenos Aires, he went to bed … that was a Monday. He stayed there till nightfall, then left the house … I don’t know why, but I knew deep down something was going to happen … he wasn’t back by ten o’clock, so I went to bed. At about one in the morning, I was awakened by his footsteps in the room. I was about to switch on the light when he leapt over towards me and grabbed my arm &mdash; you know how strong he is &mdash; pulled me out of bed in my night-dress, and dragged me along the corridors to the front door of the hotel.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What did you do?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I didn’t scream, because I knew that would only make him even angrier. In the hotel doorway he stood staring at me as if I was a total stranger, his forehead creased with pain, his eyes bulging. Outside, a high wind was whipping back the tree branches, and I was trying to protect myself with my arms, but he just stood there in silence staring at me, until a policeman came running up, and the hotel porter, who had been woken by the noise, leapt on him from behind. Then he started shouting, so loudly they could hear him at the corner of the street: ‘This is the Harlot … the one who loved thugs whose flesh is as that of asses.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You remember the exact words?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s as if it was all happening in front of my eyes right now. There he is, struggling to get back inside, with the policeman trying to pull him out and the porter throttling him to try to weaken him, while I’m standing there like an idiot waiting for it all to be over, having to put up with the stares of people who had gathered and thought it was more fun to laugh at me than to help the policeman. Just as well I always wear a long nightdress … in the end, with the help of other policemen who had responded to a youngster’s cries for help from inside the hotel, they managed to drag him down to the police station. They thought he was drunk … but it was a fit of madness … that’s what the doctor said. He was raving about Noah’s Ark …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I see … but how can I help you?” Erdosain felt yet again that her essence was becoming part of his life like something from a novel, something that needed to be taken care of like the knot of a necktie in the hurly-burly of a dance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, I was wondering if you could lend me some money. I can’t count on his family at all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Didn’t you get married in his house?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but when we got back from Montevideo after our wedding, we visited them one day … can you imagine … visiting a house where I’d been a maid!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s amazing!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can’t imagine how indignant they all were. One of his aunts … but why talk about such spiteful, mean things, don’t you agree? That’s how life is, and that’s all there is to it. They threw us out, and we went. Better luck next time.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s odd is that you were a maid.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s nothing so strange about that.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s just you don’t seem the type …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Thanks … the thing is, when I left the hotel I had to pawn a ring, and I need to be careful with what little money I have left …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the pharmacy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s being looked after by someone we can trust. I cabled for him to send money … but he replied saying he had strict instructions from the Ergueta family not to give me a cent. So …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So what are you thinking of doing?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what I don’t know … whether I should go back to Pico, or stay here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What a mess!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m really fed up with it, believe me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m sorry, but today I don’t have any money. Tomorrow I will, though.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You see, I want to keep the few pesos I have for any emergency …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re welcome to stay here until you find something long-term. There’s an empty room next to mine. What else can I do for you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“See if you can get him out of the asylum.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How can I do that if he really has gone mad? Anyway, we’ll see … for tonight, you can sleep here. I’ll manage on the sofa … although it’s likely I won’t sleep here at all …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Yet again the woman radiated her green-tinged, malevolent gaze from behind red eyelashes. It was as though she was casting her soul on to the outlines of the man’s thoughts to take an imprint of his intentions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All right, I accept.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tomorrow, if you like, I’ll give you some money to go to a hotel with, if you prefer that to staying here.” But then, suddenly angry with her for a thought which had just crossed his mind, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You don’t really seem to love Eduardo, you know …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why is that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s obvious. You come here, tell me about all this drama so coolly it amazes me, and naturally … what am I supposed to think of you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had started to pace up and down the tiny room as he was saying this. He was ill at ease again, and glanced sideways at her freckled oval face, with its fine red lashes under the green hat-brim, the lips that looked swollen, and the two bands of copper-coloured hair pulled down over her ears, while her transparent eyes shot out their beams of light.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She hardly has any breasts,” Erdosain thought. Hipólita was looking around her; suddenly, with a bright smile, she asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What exactly did you expect of me, darling?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was irritated by this sudden cheap whorehouse “darling”, coming after the casual “better luck next time”. After a while, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know … I suppose I didn’t think you were so cold … there are moments when you give the impression of being a bit unnatural … I may be wrong, but … well, anyway … that’s your business …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita stood up:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Darling, I’ve never gone in for play-acting. The reason I came here is quite straightforward: I knew you were his best friend. What d’you want? For me to cry like Mary Magdalene when I don’t feel sorry about anything? I’ve already cried enough …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had also stood up. She was staring at him, but the harsh lines &mdash; rigid beneath the skin of her face like an armour-plated will &mdash; drooped with fatigue. With her head tilted slightly to one side, she reminded Erdosain of his wife … it might well be her … she was standing in the doorway of a strange room … indifferent, the Captain looked on as she left for ever, and did not bother to stop her … the streets beckoned her … maybe she was headed for some sordid hotel … suddenly, moved to pity, Erdosain said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Forgive me … I’m a bit on edge. You’re welcome here. I’m only sorry you arrived when I have no money to offer you. But tomorrow I will.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita sat down again. As he paced back and forth, Erdosain felt his pulse. His heart was beating rapidly. Weary after the day with the Astrologer and Barsut, he said bitterly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Life’s an effort, isn’t it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The stranger stared down at the tip of her shoe in silence. She raised her eyes and a tiny wrinkle lined her brow. Then she said: “You seem worried. Is something the matter?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, nothing. Tell me … was it difficult being with him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A bit. He’s violent …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s so strange! I’d like to be able to picture him in the asylum, but I can’t. All I can make out is a fragment of his face and one eye … I must tell you, I saw the disaster coming. I met him one morning and he told me the whole story. All at once I knew you’d be unhappy with him … but you must be tired. I have to go out. I’ll tell the landlady to bring you dinner here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … I’m not hungry.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, well then, I must be off. Put the screen up if you like. Make yourself at home.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As Erdosain left, the Cripple looked him over in an extraordinary way, like a fan opening and slicing down through a man from head to toe, then snapping shut on the whole layout of his interior world.</div>

     IN THE CAVERN <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Out in the street, Erdosain realised there was a light rain falling, but he walked on, driven by an obscure anger, annoyed at being unable to think.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Everything was getting so complicated … and what was he, caught up in all these blind cogwheels that were taking over more and more of his life, pushing him ever deeper into a despairing mire? Then on top of it all, there was this … this inability to think, to think things through clearly, like moves in a chess game, a lack of mental clarity that made him resentful of everyone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was irritated above all by the animal content of the shopkeepers, standing at the doorways of their holes spitting into the slanting rain. Erdosain imagined they were endlessly scheming, while in the back rooms their unfortunate wives could be seen, laying cloths on rickety tables, hashing up disgusting stews which gave off a stale smell of peppers and grease, or the rancid odours of reheated escalopes when the lids were taken off.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain walked on sullenly, trying to fathom the ideas being hatched in those narrow minds, openly peering at the wan faces of the shopkeepers as they spied, a spark of fury deep in their eyes, on the customers they could see in the stores opposite them. At times, Erdosain felt on the point of shouting insults at them; he longed to call them cuckolds, thieves, sons of bitches, tell them to their faces that if they were fat it was because they were swollen with leprosy, and if they were thin it was because they were consumed with envy of their neighbours. And in his mind, he poured dreadful curses on their heads, imagining they were all so deep in debt they were on the verge of bankruptcy, while at the same time he wished that the unhappiness that cast him into the pit of despair would also fall on their filthy wives who, with the same fingers they had used a few moments earlier to remove the towels they menstruated into, were now cutting the bread they would eat together, slandering their rivals with each mouthful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Although he could not explain why, Erdosain felt repelled by even the most respectable of these chisellers: the whole tribe was as vicious and ruthless as a band of Moorish pirates.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he walked past upholsterers, general stores and dressmakers’ shops, Erdosain was thinking that these people were without any noble aim, that they spent their whole time spying with malicious glee on their neighbours’ private lives &mdash; neighbours who were as worthless as them, gloating with expressions of fake compassion at all the misfortunes that befell them, spreading tittle-tattle on all sides out of sheer boredom. This suddenly made him feel so angry he realised it would be best if he got off the street before he became involved in an incident with one of these brutes, whose revolting image was for him a symbol of the soul of the entire city, every bit as mean-spirited, remorseless and vicious as them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He had no firm idea in mind, though he knew he was tainted with disgust for life, but all at once he saw a tram heading for Plaza Once, so he ran and jumped on the back platform. At the station he bought a return to Ramos Mejía. It made little difference to him where he was going. He was weary, at a loss, convinced he had thrown his soul into a ditch from where he would never recover it. And with the Cripple at home waiting for him. How much better to be the captain of a ship, to command some super-dreadnought! The funnels would be belching out plumes of smoke, while on the bridge he would be talking with the first officer, the image of a woman &mdash; perhaps not his wife &mdash; tattooed on his heart. Why on earth was his life like this? And other people’s lives too, they were “like this”, as if the “like this” were a seal guaranteeing unhappiness, which we simply found harder to spot in others.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What had become of the power of life, which some men seem to have coursing through their veins like the blood of a lion? A power which makes someone’s existence suddenly stand out before us without any rehearsal, as clearly defined as a film plot. Wasn’t that what photos of great men showed? Who had any record of Lenin arguing in a miserable room in London, or of Mussolini wandering the roads of Italy? And yet there they suddenly were, on a balcony haranguing the hirsute crowds, or striding among the shattered columns of a recent ruin, in sports shoes and a straw boater which failed to conceal their fierce conqueror’s features. By contrast, Erdosain’s life was filled with tiny images of the Cripple, the Captain, his wife, Barsut: all of them people who as soon as they were out of his sight were reduced to the minuscule dimensions that distance confers on physical objects.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He rested his head against the glass window. The carriage started to move off, then came to a halt; the guard’s whistle sounded a second time and the whole train pulled out, clanking as it crossed the points which screeched as the wheels forced them apart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The green and red lights of the tunnel dazzled his eyes for an instant, so he shut them again. In the darkness, the train conveyed its quivering hesitancy to the rails, and its mass multiplied by the speed it was travelling at, lent Erdosain’s thoughts a similarly ponderous, relentless impetus.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Clackety-clack went the wheels at the end of each length of rail, and gradually this dull, insistent rhythm soothed his anger and lifted his spirits, while the speed of the train lulled his body into a state of somnolence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He began to think about Ergueta’s madness. He remembered the other man’s words when he himself had been staring ruin in the face: “get lost, you bum, get lost”. He settled his head on the padded seatback and recalled earlier days. He closed his eyes to focus better on the images in his memory. These were a puzzle to him at first: this was the first time he realised that whereas some figures in the mind’s eye are the same size as we have known them in reality, other people and things are tiny, like lead soldiers, and only appear in silhouette, without any depth to them. So, next to a huge black man whose hand had strayed to a young boy’s rear, he saw a tiny table like something out of a doll’s house, on which drooped the minute heads of a gang of hoodlums, although the ceiling above them was at its proper height, all of which only served to make the grey outlines of his recollection even more desolate.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An obscure crowd milled about inside his mind; then a shadow covered his anguish like a cloud of weariness, and next to the table where the tiny adult criminals lay sleeping, he could make out the huge looming shape &mdash; like an ox’s skull &mdash; of the bar owner, digging his fingers into bulging arm muscles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Another flash of memory showed Erdosain how true his sense of imminent downfall had been, before he had even begun to think of swindling the Sugar Company, but was already searching in dark corners for a possible reflection of his personality.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">How many pathways there were in his brain! He pursued the one which took him back to the enormous bar which sunk its morose block into the deepest recesses of his mind, and although this block piercing the length of his skull sloped at an angle of twenty degrees, the tiny tables where the criminals sprawled asleep did not &mdash; as would have been logical &mdash; slide down, but thanks to the way his mind was accustomed to immediately adjusting the perspective, straightened up beneath them. Erdosain’s body too had grown used to the hurtling mass of the underground train, so he lolled back in his seat in a kind of dizzy stupor, and now that memory had overcome every ounce of resistance in him, he was flooded by the clear, precise outlines of the bar.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">These outlines seemed to project themselves directly into his chest, so that he could almost imagine that if he looked at himself in a mirror, the front of his body would show the interior of a narrow room, stretching out towards the mirror. And so Erdosain found himself walking along inside himself on a floor covered with spit and sawdust, the image perfectly framed in a way that reflected on to an infinite repetition of the same sensations.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And he thought that if the Cripple had been with him, he would have said of this recollection:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That was before I was a thief.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain imagined the Cripple turning to look at him while he continued in an off-hand way: “Next to the old Crítica building in Sarmiento there used to be a bar.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then, as his train clattered across the junction at Caballito, he imagined Hipólita raising her eyes to him inquisitively. Erdosain saw himself as a character who had lived outside the law but had now gone straight, so he added to his invisible companion:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The regulars there were a mix of newspaper vendors and criminals.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is that so?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">To avoid the windows being smashed in one of the many fights these unsavoury characters got into, the bar owner kept the metal shutters permanently down. The only light reaching the saloon came in through the blue-tinted panes of the door, so that this den with its grey walls like an Arab butcher’s shop was perpetually sunk in a gloom relieved only by the milky gleam of cigarette smoke.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In that dimly lit cavern, with its heavy-beamed ceiling and filled with steam from vegetable stews and cooking fat, seethed a dark throng of the criminal fraternity, men with caps pulled down over their faces, and kerchiefs casually knotted at the neck of undershirts.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Between eleven and two in the afternoon they crowded round the greasy marble tables to gulp down rotten clams or play cards over a few glasses of wine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Faces amid the foul-smelling gloom confirmed the lowlife atmosphere. Some were long and drawn-out, as if their owners were being strangled, their mouths gaping open, their lips swollen and floppy as sausages. Black men with porcelain eyes and gleaming white teeth between thick blubbery lips were touching up youngsters, grinding their jaws with pleasure; petty crooks and informers who looked like tigers, with sloping foreheads and unwavering gazes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An indistinct babble of voices rose from these men, slumped on benches or gathered around the tables, in between which strolled the con-men in their decent clothes &mdash; soft collars, grey waistcoats, seven-peso bowler hats. Some of them were just out of Azcuenaga gaol, and passed on messages they had been given by prisoners there; others were wearing tortoise-shell glasses to inspire confidence; each and everyone of them quickly scanned the place when they came in. They all talked in whispers, bought bottles of beer for their odd companions, and came and went several times in a quarter of an hour, as they were called out on some shady business or other. The boss of this establishment was a huge man with an ox’s head, green eyes, a bulbous nose and thin, tight lips.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Whenever he got angry, his bellowing immediately subdued his customers, who were all terrified of him. He controlled them with the threat of violence. If one of the criminals made more noise than was tacitly allowed, the owner would suddenly come over: the offender knew what was about to happen, but sat there waiting in silence until the giant started pounding on his skull with short sharp blows.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rest of the bar would fall silent as the others enjoyed the punishment. The unfortunate victim was kicked out into the street, and the hubbub rose again, as fresh clouds of smoke wafted towards the glass front door.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sometimes musicians found their way into this den, usually with a bandoneon and a guitar. As they tuned up, an expectant hush fell over the denizens of this aquatic world, and an imperceptible wave of sadness swept through the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As the plaintive strains of a lowlife tango rose from the instruments, all the crooks accompanied it with their rage and misfortunes. The silence was like a many-handed monster that raised a dome of sound over heads drooping on to marble tables. Who knows what their thoughts were! And that huge, terrible dome pierced all their hearts, amplifying the mournful sounds of the guitar and bandoneon until there was something sublime in a whore’s suffering, or in the oppressive boredom of prison when the inmate imagines his friends living life to the full on the outside.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At some point even the most fetid souls there, the most bestial of features, gave way to an unheard-of trembling &mdash; but this vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, and when the musicians passed round their cap, not a single hand stretched out to drop in a coin.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s where I used to go,” Erdosain told his imaginary companion, “to confirm my anguish, to know for sure I was lost, and to think of my wife suffering alone at home because she had married someone so worthless. How often in a corner of that bar have I pictured her running away with some other man, while I was sinking lower and lower; and that hole was nothing but the foretaste of what was to happen to me later on. How often, looking at those poor wretches, have I thought to myself: perhaps one day I’ll be exactly the same? I don’t know how, but I’ve always felt I knew beforehand what was going to happen to me. I’ve never been wrong. Can you imagine? Then one day in that cavern I met Ergueta deep in thought. Yes, Ergueta. He was sitting alone at a table, and some of the newspaper boys were staring at him in amazement, although others must have thought he was simply a well-dressed thief.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Erdosain imagined that at this point the Cripple asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What, my husband was there too?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, gnawing at the handle of his cane with that dog-catcher’s face of his, while a black man was busy caressing some young boy’s rear. But Ergueta didn’t notice anything going on around him. It was as if he was nailed to the floor of the cavern. He told me he was there waiting for a contact to give him a tip for the next race, but the truth is, it was as if he had suddenly felt lost and had come in there in the hope of finding some meaning to life. It may have been exactly that. Looking for a meaning to life in those crooks’ behaviour. That was when I found out he planned to marry a whore, and when I asked him about his pharmacy he told me he’d put someone from Pico in charge, because his intention was to come to Buenos Aires and gamble. I don’t know if you heard he was thrown out of one club for cheating. It was even said he was trying to pass off fake chips, but that was never proved. I first heard of you when I asked him about his fiancee, a young millionairess from Cachari who was madly in love with him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘I broke that off a while back,’ he told me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘Why?’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘I don’t know … I was fed up … bored.’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I insisted:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘But why did you drop her?’</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A sour gleam shone in his eyes. He waved his hand to drive off the flies circling round his beer mug, and growled:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘How should I know? Because I was so bored … because I’m such a mug. And the poor girl really loved me. But what could I offer her? Anyway, all that’s water under the bridge …’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ergueta said that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes. His exact words were: ‘that’s all water under the bridge, because tomorrow I’m marrying someone else’.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The train pulled out of Flores. Hunched in his seat, Erdosain recalled how he had studied the pharmacist’s face as a nervous muscular twitch lent it an evil look.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And who are you marrying?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta’s face turned white. As he leant his huge head forward towards Erdosain, his left eye winked, while the other one seemed to disassociate itself from the rest, holding back to observe the surprise that would soon render Erdosain speechless:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m marrying the Harlot,” he said, lifting a face in which his eyes had now rolled back completely.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I didn’t move,” Erdosain told me later.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist had an expression of such ecstasy on his face that he looked like one of those saints in a popular lithograph kneeling with hands clasped to his chest in devotion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain remembered that while this was going on, the black man who had been touching up the boy’s behind now placed the youngster’s hands on his private parts; a gaggle of newspaper vendors was engaged in a shouting match, and the giant bar owner was striding across the room with a plate of soup in one hand and a reddish stew in the other, ordered by two famished pick-pockets over in a corner.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And yet he was not really surprised by the decision. Ergueta had made this kind of desperate choice because he was one of those hysterics whose obsessions lend them a kind of slow-burning fury, a deep-down explosion they do not hear go off, but whose shock waves increase their sensitivity a hundred times. However, Erdosain put on a show of remaining completely calm and asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The Harlot … who is the Harlot?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Blood rushed back to Ergueta’s face. His eyes began to sparkle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who is she? … She’s an angel, Erdosain. In front of these eyes, my very own eyes, she tore up a 2,000-peso cheque a lover had given her. She gave her maid a pearl necklace worth 5,000 pesos. She gave the porter and his wife all her silverware. ‘I’ll enter your house naked,’ she told me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But that’s all lies!” Erdosain imagined Hipólita saying to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“At the time, I believed him. And he went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘If you only knew all that woman has suffered. Once, after her seventh abortion, she was so desperate she went to throw herself out of the fourth-floor window of the clinic. All of a sudden … it’s incredible … but Jesus appeared to her on the balcony. He stretched out his arm and would not let her jump.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta was still smiling. All at once he put his hand in his pocket and handed Erdosain a photo.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The delicious creature was very appealing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She was not smiling. The background contained a scattering of palm trees and ferns. She was sitting on a bench with her head slightly tilted as she read a magazine on her knee. With her legs crossed, this gave her dress a bell shape above the grassy lawn. Her hair was scraped back and piled high on her head, which made the moon of her forehead seem even broader and more luminous. Her eyebrows formed a slender arch above her fine nose, perfectly setting off her slightly slanting eyes in the delicate oval of her face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he stared at the photograph, Erdosain felt sure he would never feel any desire for Hipólita, and this certainty made him so happy he began to imagine how wonderful it would be to caress this odd creature under her chin, or to hear the sand crunching beneath her sandals. He muttered:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How beautiful she looks! She must have a sensitive soul!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">How different she was in reality!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By now, the train was passing through Villa Luro. The electric lights shone sadly among the coal heaps and the gasometers shrouded in mist. Great black holes opened in the side of engine roundhouses, and the sight of red and green lights suspended here and there in the distance only made the train whistles sound even more plaintive.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">How different the Cripple was in reality! Yet Erdosain rcmembered saying to Ergueta:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How beautiful she is! … She must have a sensitive soul!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s right. Everything about her is delightful. I like adventure. Imagine the faces of all those who doubted my communist credentials! I’ve dropped a money-bags, a virgin, to marry a prostitute. But Hipólita’s soul is what really marks her out. She also loves adventure and noble hearts. Together we can do great things, because the times are at hand …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain took up the pharmacist’s phrase:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you think the time is at hand? …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, dreadful things are bound to happen. Don’t you remember you once told me even President Roosevelt was full of praise for the Bible?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but that was a long time ago.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain said that because in fact he could not recall ever having said anything of the sort to Ergueta, who now insisted: “I’ve been reading the Bible a lot in the country …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Which doesn’t stop you living as recklessly as ever.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s not the point,” Ergueta cut in sharply. Irritated, Erdosain stared at him, but the pharmacist merely smiled a childish smile and as the barman placed another mug of beer in front of him, went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Just listen to these mysterious words I found in the Bible: ‘And I shall save the Cripple, I will lead the lost sheep back into the fold and raise their names up to be praised in every country of confusion.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At this, an extraordinary silence fell over the bar. All that could be seen were bowed heads or little groups staring at the antics of flies on the sticky grime of the table-tops. One thief was showing a colleague a jewelled ring; their two heads bent together to examine the stones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A ray of sunlight shone in through the half-open glass door, slicing the smoky blue atmosphere in two like a bar of sulphur.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta said again: “and I shall save the Cripple, and will lead the lost sheep back” emphasising with a malicious wink the words as he finished, “and raise their names up to be praised in every country of confusion.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But Hipólita isn’t a cripple …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, but she is the lost sheep and I am the swindler, the ‘son of perdition’. I’ve gone from brothel to brothel, from anguish to anguish in search of love. I thought I was looking for physical love, but after I read the holy book I saw that what my heart was yearning for was divine love. See? The heart follows its own secret path. You get big ideas, you think you know what you want, and yet you can’t get it … you don’t know why … it’s a mystery … Then one day, out of the blue, the truth appears. And as you know, I’ve lived the life of a ‘son of perdition’; that’s been my life. Before he died coughing up blood in Cosquin, my father wrote me a terrible letter full of recriminations. And he didn’t sign it with his name, but put: ‘Your father, the Cursed one’. What d’you make of that?” At this, Ergueta’s nervous wink lifted both eyebrows so alarmingly that Erdosain asked himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What if he’s mad?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then the two of them left the bar. Cars glided down Corrientes gleaming in the sun, a crowd of people passed by on their way to work, and the yellow shop awnings gave all the women’s faces a colourful tinge. They went into the Ambos Mundos café. Groups of shady-looking characters sat round the tables, playing cards or dice. Others were playing billiards. Ergueta took a good look round, then spat and said out loud:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A load of pimps. They should all be strung up without even bothering to see who they are.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">No-one took the insult personally.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Despite himself, Erdosain found he could not forget some of Ergueta’s earlier words: “I was looking for divine love.” In those days, Ergueta was leading a sensual, frenzied life. He spent all day and night in gambling dens and whorehouses, dancing, getting drunk, picking terrible fights with crooks and pimps. A blind impulse drove him to commit the most appalling deeds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">One night Ergueta was in Flores Square, opposite the Niers cafeteria. He was with Delavene the drunk, who had qualified as a lawyer a month earlier, and lots of other rowdies from the Flores Club. They were jostling and abusing all the passers-by. Spotting a Spanish immigrant coming up to them, Ergueta undid his fly and as the man reached level, sent a stream of urine over him. The Spaniard thought better than to argue, and walked off cursing. So then the pharmacist challenged Delavene, who was always boasting of his exploits:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK … I bet you won’t piss on the first person to come by.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re on.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Everyone guffawed, because they knew Delavene the Basque was a wild animal. Soon, a man turned the corner in front of them, and Delavene started to urinate. The stranger tried to move out of the way, but the Basque almost fell on top of him, and succeeded in soaking him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then something terrible happened.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Without a word, the victim came to a halt. The gang of men was laughing and whistling, when all of a sudden he pulled out a gun, a shot rang out, and Delavene fell to his knees clutching his stomach. The Basque had a slow and horrible death. Before he died, he nobly admitted he had been the one to blame, and afterwards whenever Ergueta got drunk and Delavene’s name was mentioned, he would kneel down and trace a cross with his tongue in the dust.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do you remember the Basque?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he rolled a cigarette, the pharmacist gave him a long, hard look, then said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, he had a noble heart … he was one in a million. Some day I’m going to pay for him,” but then, switching his thoughts back to a more recent concern, he went on: “I’ve been thinking a lot lately. I was wondering if it was right for a sterile, ill, dissolute man like me to marry a virgin …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Does Hipólita know?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, she knows everything. And besides, if the woman is a virgin, the man should be too. He should be virgin of body and soul. That’s how things will be some day. Can you imagine a handsome, strong and virgin male like that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s how it should be,” Erdosain murmured.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist glanced at his watch.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you have something to do?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I need to go home to see Hipólita soon.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That really surprised me,” Erdosain told the author of this story later on &mdash; the Ergueta family had a luxury mansion, and the mentality of the people who crept around like snails in it was completely conservative and conventional. Erdosain asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What d’you mean? You took her home?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can’t imagine all the tales I had to invent! She didn’t want to go … or rather, she accepted the idea, but insisted on hiding nothing …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She didn’t!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She did: I only managed to get her to change her mind at the very last moment. I told mamma I had snatched her from her relatives just as they were boarding a ship for Europe … a real cock and bull story!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about your mother?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain had been on the point of asking him if his mother had been taken in by a lie like that, as if Hipólita’s face bore the traces of the harsh ways she had earned her living …</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How did your mother react?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She told me to take her home at once. When I presented her, she kissed her and asked: ‘Has he respected you, daughter?’ And Hipólita lowered her gaze and responded ‘Yes, mamma.’ What’s more, it was true. I should tell you that both she and my sister Sara are delighted with her.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he said that, Erdosain had the sudden foreboding that this hapless couple were heading for disaster. He had not been mistaken, and as he sat in the underground train while it rumbled through Liniers, he remembered how right he had been and said to himself: “It’s strange, first impressions are never wrong.” Back then, he had asked Ergueta when they were getting married:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’re leaving for Montevideo tomorrow. That’s where we’re holding the ceremony, in case we don’t get on” &mdash; as he said this, his eyebrow shot up again and he smiled cynically, adding: “I’m nobody’s fool, you know.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was incensed at this kind of precaution. Unable to restrain himself, he protested:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How’s that? … You’re not yet married but you’re already thinking about divorce? So what kind of a communist act is that? Deep down you’re still just a cheating gambler.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist simply gloated at this, as proud of himself as a loan shark who will accept any insult provided it’s made by someone paying up. He cackled:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You have to be on the ball, my friend.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was appalled by such a callous attitude.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He thought of the delicious creature in the photo and imagined her having to put up with this monster under a sky swept by dark dust clouds and an awful burning yellow sun. She would wilt like a fern transplanted to a rock pile. Erdosain stared angrily at his companion.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The gambler noticed how annoyed he was, but said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have to do something to bring down this society. There are days when I suffer unbearably. It’s as if everything that happens is out of control, like a plunging wild beast. It makes me want to go out into the street and preach mass murder, or to set up a machine gun on every street corner. You must see it: terrible times are coming.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“‘The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father.’ We have to do something to strike back at this accursed society. That’s why I’m marrying a prostitute. As the Scriptures say: ‘And you, son of man, are to judge the bloodthirsty city, and to show all its abominations.’ And what about this, just listen to this: ‘And she fell in love with thieves whose flesh is as that of asses, whose liquids stream out like those of horses.’” At that he turned and pointed to the pimps clustered round the tables playing cards, and said: “Look at them. Go into the Royal Keller, to Marzzoto’s, to the Pigall or the Maipú, and you’ll see them everywhere. Lost souls. Even riff-raff like them are bored to death. Come the revolution and they’ll either be strung up or sent to the front line. Cannon fodder. I could have been like them, but I changed my mind. A terrible time is coming. That’s why the holy book says: ‘I will save the Cripple and return the lost sheep to the fold because the city is enamoured of its thieves, and they are the ones who crushed the Cripple and led the sheep astray, but some day soon they will have to prostrate themselves and kiss their feet.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But do you love Hipólita?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course I do. Sometimes I think she must have climbed down from the moon on a ladder. Wherever she is, people will be happy.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And for an instant Erdosain truly believed she had indeed climbed down from the moon so that the whole of mankind could rejoice in her calm simplicity.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A time of blood is at hand, a time of vengeance. The soul of mankind is weeping. But no-one wants to listen to the tears of their angel. And our cities are like the whores, enamoured of their criminals, their thieves. It can’t go on.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He stared out into the street for a moment, and then said in a sorrowful tone, as if listening to a voice inside him in this sad café:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What we need is for someone, some angel, to appear. People would fall to their knees in the Avenida de Mayo. Cars would come to a halt, bank managers and the rich in their hotels would come out on to their balconies and wave their arms about, shouting at him indignantly: ‘What do you want, toad face? Don’t bother us’, but he will arise, and their arms will drop to their sides when they see his tiny soulful face, his eyes burning with fever, and he’ll address all these stuck-up people, he’ll talk to them, ask them why they have done wrong, why they have forgotten the orphans and abused their fellow man, why they’ve made a hell out of life when it can be so beautiful. And they’ll not know what to answer, and the voice of the avenging angel will ring out so loudly that their hair will stand on end, and even the most heartless of them will weep.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The pharmacist’s bulging mouth twisted in anguish, as if he had swallowed a viscous, bitter poison.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, we need Christ to come again. Even the lowest of men, even the most disgusting cynics are full of suffering. And if He doesn’t come, who else can save us?”</div>

     THE ESPILA FAMILY <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The train stopped at Ramos Mejía. The station clock was showing eight at night. Erdosain got off.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A dense fog hung over the muddy streets of the suburb.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Away from the station in Centenario, with a wall of fog in front and another behind him, he remembered that the next day they were going to kill Barsut. It was true. They were going to kill him. Erdosain would have liked to have a mirror to hold up so he could see his murderer’s body, so incredible did it seem that he was the one (the “I”) who through this crime was about to separate himself from the rest of humanity.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The streetlamps shone feebly, their shafts of woolly light only penetrating the dark of the pavements for a couple of yards, while the rest of the suburb remained invisible. Filled with an immense sorrow, Erdosain walked on as disconsolate as a leper.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He felt as though his soul had finally become detached for ever from any human emotion. His anguish was that of a man who carries a fearful cage inside him, where prowling, blood-stained tigers yawn among a heap of fish bones, their remorseless eyes poised for their next leap.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he walked on, Erdosain considered his life as if it were this other person’s, trying to understand the forces that rose from the tips of his fingernails to howl in his ears like a hot dusty wind.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Immersed in the fog whose clammy dankness penetrated even the furthest recesses of his lungs, Erdosain eventually reached Gaona, where he stopped to wipe the sweat from his brow.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He banged on a wooden gate, the only entrance to a huge shed lit by a single kerosene lamp. A hand pulled the door open, then the figure of a young man muttering obscenities disappeared round the corner of the building along a brick path that rocked uneasily under his feet in the mud.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain came to a halt outside a lighted glass door. He clapped his hands and a hoarse voice shouted: “Come in!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain went in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The sooty flame of an oil lamp lit the five heads of the Espila family, as they peered up from their supper plates. They all greeted him with cheerful smiles, and Emilio Espila, a tall thin youngster with a mop of hair, leapt up to shake his hand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain greeted them one by one: first the mother, bent double by her years and dressed all in black; then Luciana and Elena, the two young sisters; then Eustaquio, who was deaf and such a long thin streak of a man it seemed he must have tuberculosis. As usual, he was poring over a magazine while his nose was deep in his plate, his grey eyes flitting to and fro as they deciphered the pictures.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The warm smiles the two girls gave him made Erdosain feel a little better. Luciana was blonde, and had a long face with a snub nose and a wide thin mouth with bright pink sensual lips, while there was something of the nun about Elena, with her waxy, oval face and long skirts, her plump pale hands.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Will you eat with us?” the mother wanted to know.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Noting how little there was in the pot, Erdosain replied that he had already eaten.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you sure?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … I’ll just have some tea.” They made room for him at the table, and Erdosain sat down between deaf Eustaquio, who went on puzzling out his magazine, and Elena, who shared out the rest of the stew between Emilio and her mother.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain looked at them with a sense of pity. He had known them for many years. At first the family had been relatively well-to-do, but then a series of disasters had left them in complete misery. One day Erdosain had bumped into Emilio in the street and had paid them a visit. He had not seen them for seven years and was amazed to find them all living in a wretched hovel when before they had had a maid, parlour and living-room. The three women slept in the same room cluttered with old furniture, that they used to eat lunch and supper in; Emilio and Eustaquio slept in the lean-to kitchen with its tin roof. They took on a fantastic variety of jobs to try to make ends meet: selling brochures, homemade ice cream, dressmaking in the case of the two sisters. One winter they were so hard up they stole a telegraph pole and sawed it up in the night. On another occasion, they took a whole row of fence-posts; the scrapes they got into to raise money amused and at the same time saddened Erdosain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The first time he had seen them in their new surroundings had been a great shock. The Espila family had moved into a ramshackle three-storey building near Chacarita, divided up by corrugated iron sheets. From the outside the tenement looked like a huge ocean liner, with kids swarming all over it as if it were a religious commune. For days afterwards, Erdosain walked around trying to imagine what the Espila family must have to put up with to live in such a state. Later, when he invented the copper rose, he thought that this new hope might lift their spirits, so with part of the money he stole from the Sugar Company he bought a second-hand accumulator, an amp-meter and the other equipment needed to set up a simple galvano-plastics workshop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He managed to persuade the Espilas to devote their spare time to his experiments, arguing that if they were successful they would all be rich. And he, whose life was so bereft of consolation or hope, he, who had felt so lost for so long, instilled such keen hopes in them that they agreed to give it a try. Elena began to seriously study galvano-plastics, while Eustaquio learnt how to prepare the chemical baths and to join up the amp-meter wires in series or in opposition, and to measure the resistance. Even their mother took part in the experiments, and when they managed to coat a sheet of tin with copper, they were all convinced that all they had to do was to apply the process to roses, for their fortunes to be made.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain also spoke of making gold lacework, silver curtains, copper veils for hats. He even mentioned the possibility of a metallic necktie, which astonished them all. Or they could make shirts with metallic fronts, cuffs and collars, by taking cloth, soaking it in a saline solution, then putting it through a galvano-plastic bath of copper or nickel. Gath Chaves, Harrods or San Juan would buy the patent. One day Erdosain, who only half-believed in all this, began to think he had gone too far in stimulating these fantasies, because now, despite the fact that they made no money and were almost dying of hunger, they dreamt at the very least of buying a Rolls-Royce and a mansion, which had to be on Alvear Avenue or nowhere at all. As Erdosain bent over his tea-cup, Luciana, blushing slightly, responded to Emilio’s questioning smile with a shake of the head &mdash; but he carried on regardless, blurting out with a ferocious lisp because he had hardly a tooth in his head:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Gueth what … the rothe is a realithy …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, we’ve managed to make one, thank God!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Luciana jumped up, opened a sideboard drawer, and Erdosain smiled with delight. Between the fingers of the fair maiden gleamed the copper rose. The marvellous metal flower spread its vermilion petals through the wretched hovel. The lamp’s quivering flame picked out a red transparent glow, as if the flower contained a botanical life that had been consumed by the acids, but was its very soul.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The deaf brother lifted his nose from his plate of endives. He looked first at his pictures then at the rose, and exclaimed in a booming voice:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s no two ways about it, Erdosain… you’re a genius …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yeth … with thith we’re bound to be rithch …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“God willing …” said the old lady.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t be tho doubting, mother!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Was it a lot of work?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">With a serious smile, Elena launched into a scientific explanation: “Listen, Remo, the first time round Emilio here gave it too many amperes, so the rose was singed …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And the bath didn’t precipitate?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … so we warmed it up a bit …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then for this one, we added some fixing agent …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Thath’s right … a bath of fixer … thlowly …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Remo examined the rose again, marvelling at its perfection. Each red petal was almost transparent, and below the metal film he could just make out the veins of the natural petal, which the fixing agent had turned slightly black. It weighed hardly anything, and Erdosain added:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How light it is! It weighs less than a five-cent piece …” But then, noticing a yellow stain on the flower’s pistils that spread up into the petals, he went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“When you take the flowers out of the chemical bath you need to wash them very carefully. See these yellow lines? They’re from the cyanide in the bath, which is eating away the copper.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The circle of heads clustered round him, listening in religious awe. He continued: “It forms copper cyanate, and we don’t want that because it attacks the nickel plating. How long did it take?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“An hour.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When Erdosain raised his eyes from the flower, he found Luciana staring at him. Her eyes were velvety with a mysterious warmth, and her broad smile revealed gleaming teeth. Puzzled, Erdosain looked at her. Her deaf brother was examining the rose, while all the other heads peered over his shoulder at the yellow streaks of cyanide. Luciana was still staring at him. All at once, Erdosain remembered that the next morning he was to help kill Barsut, and an intense sadness led him to lower his eyes. This gave way almost immediately to a feeling of anger at these deluded people who had no idea of all the suffering and anguish he had been through over the past few months. He stood up and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“All right then, I’ll be seeing you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Even the deaf Eustaquio looked up in horror. The old woman stood rooted to the spot, her hand outstretched holding a plate she was about to give him. Elena pushed back her chair: “What’s the matter, Remo?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But … Erdosain …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Elena looked him up and down:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is something wrong, Remo?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Nothing, Elena, believe me …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you angry?” asked Luciana, her eyes full of their mysterious, sad warmth. “No, not at all … I really wanted to see you all … but now I have to go …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you sure you’re not angry?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, señora.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I understhand … all the worries you hafth …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Shut up, you fool!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Eustaquio decided to abandon his magazine and repeat what he had said earlier. “I warn you, you’ve got to take this seriously, it means you’ll be rich.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you sure nothing is wrong?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain picked up his hat. He felt a deep disgust at having to say all these useless things. Everything was settled anyway. So what was the point of talking? Yet he made one last effort, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Believe me … I like you all a lot … just as much as before … don’t worry … I’m not angry … I’ve got lots more ideas … we can set up a dog’s hair salon and sell pets dyed green, blue, yellow and purple … as you can see, I’m not short of ideas … you’ll get out of this horrible misery one day … I’ll make sure of that … as you can see, I have more than enough ideas.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Luciana looked at him with pity in her eyes. She said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll come with you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two of them went out to the street.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The fog blocked off the road beyond sad patches of light around the oil streetlamps. Suddenly, Luciana grasped Erdosain’s arm and whispered to him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I care for you so much, I really do.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain shot her an ironic glance. All his anguish had turned to cruelty. He said: “I know.” She went on: “I love you so much that just to please you I’ve studied how a blast furnace and a Bessemer converter work. D’you want me to explain what the joists are for, or how the cooling process is carried out?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stared at her coldly. He was thinking: “There’s something wrong with this woman.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I always think of you. D’you want me to explain how to analyse different types of steel, or how to smelt copper? Or the gold-washing process; or what muffles are in furnaces?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain gritted his teeth. He stumbled along the street thinking only that man’s existence is absurd, and an inexplicable anger rose in him again, directed against this sweet girl who was clutching his arm and saying:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you remember that time you told me your ideal was to be in charge of a blast furnace? The thought drove me crazy. Why don’t you say anything? So I began to study metallurgy. Shall I tell you the difference between an irregular carbon distribution and a molecularly perfect one? Why don’t you say anything, dear?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A train rushed by in the distance, the cotton wool of the fog turned to pitch blackness a few feet from the streetlamps, and Erdosain would have liked to speak, to tell Luciana of all his misfortunes, but still his obscure, angry resentment kept him tense and silent at her side, as she went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s the matter? Are you angry with us? But it’s you we’ll have to thank for our fortune.” Erdosain looked her up and down. He grasped her arm roughly and growled:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m not interested in you.” Then he turned on his heel, and before she had time to react, strode off quickly into the fog.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He knew he had gratuitously insulted her, but this only gave him such a cruel sense of satisfaction that he muttered under his breath:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I hope they all croak and leave me in peace.”</div>

     TWO SOULS <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">At two the next morning, Erdosain was still struggling through walls of wind in the downtown streets, searching for a brothel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A dull buzzing rang in his ears, but still a frantic instinct drove him on through the shadows that the tall house-fronts cast on the pavement. He was filled with an overpowering sadness. He wandered on aimlessly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Like a sleepwalker he went on, staring glassy-eyed at the nickel arrows of the badges on policemen’s helmets as they glinted in street-corner lights, the scrolls of brightness from the neon lamps … an extraordinary impulse kept him striding on. He had come all the way from the Plaza de Mayo, and now was heading up Cangallo past the Plaza Once.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was filled with a dreadful sadness. His mind was stuck endlessly on the same point. He said over and over to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s useless. I’m a murderer.” Yet whenever he glimpsed the red or yellow light over the porch of a brothel, he stopped, hesitated for a moment, bathed in the coloured mist, then said to himself: “It must be another one,” and went on his way again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A car passed silently by him and disappeared at speed. Erdosain thought of the happiness he would never enjoy, of his lost youth; and his shadow first stretched out across the pavement, then grew shorter, disappeared under his footsteps, and reappeared dancing at his back or flickering across a shiny sewer grating … but his anguish was getting heavier by the minute, like a tidal wave sapping the strength from his limbs. In spite of this, Erdosain imagined that by a stroke of providence he had finally found the brothel he was searching for.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The madam opened the door to the bedroom, and he flung himself down fully dressed on the bed. In one corner water was boiling on a small paraffin burner … all of a sudden the half-naked girl came in … and stopping short in an astonishment that only the two of them understood, the prostitute exclaimed:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, so it’s you … it’s you … you came at last!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And Erdosain replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, it’s me. If you only knew how I’ve searched for you!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But since it was impossible for this to happen, Erdosain’s sorrow bounced back like a lead ball off a rubber wall. And he also knew that as the days went by his wish to have an unknown whore take pity on him would become as useless as that lead ball for piercing a hole in the armour of life. He said to himself once more:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Ah, so it’s you … it’s you … you came at last, my sad love! …” but it was all pointless, he would never find that woman; and so once more a fierce energy born of desperation filled his muscles, spread through his seventy kilos, gave him a fresh impetus to plunge on through the shadows, while within the block of his chest, an immense sadness tore his heartbeats to shreds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">To his surprise he found himself outside the front door of his rooming-house. He decided to go in. His heart was pounding wildly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He crossed the corridor to his room on tiptoe, and opened the door carefully. He felt his way over to the corner where the sofa was, and slowly curled up on it, trying hard not to make any noise. Later on, he could not explain why he had done this. Then he stretched out on the sofa and lay with his hands cupped behind his head. It was even darker in his soul than in the darkness around him, which would turn into a wall-papered box if he lit the lamp. He tried to think of something outside himself, but it was impossible. This created a childish fear in him; he strained his ears, listening for some sound, but in vain, so he closed his eyes. His heart was pounding loudly, pushing the mass of blood round his body; the hairs on his back stood on end as if cold water was pouring down it. With his eyelids clamped shut and his body rigid, he waited for something to happen. Then he realised that if he stayed like that he would cry out with fear, so he drew up his feet until he was sitting cross-legged like a buddha, and sat in the darkness. He felt torn to pieces, but could not call out to anyone, or even cry. But he could not stay squatting like that all night.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He lit a cigarette and was frozen with shock.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Cripple was standing at the edge of the screen, staring at him with her poisonous cold gaze. Her hair hung down to the tips of her ears in two smooth bands, and her lips were pursed. She seemed anxious to help him, but Erdosain was frightened. At last he mumbled:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The match was burning his fingers … then an impulse stronger than his shyness drove him to get up. He went over to her in the darkness and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You? Why weren’t you asleep?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He sensed she was stretching out her arm, then felt her fingers cupping his chin. Hipólita said gravely: “And why can’t you sleep?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re stroking me?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why can’t you sleep?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re touching me? How cold your hand is! Why is it so cold?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Light the lamp.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Light poured down from the ceiling. Erdosain stood staring at her as she sat on the sofa. He murmured shyly: “Shall I sit beside you? I couldn’t sleep.” Hipólita made room for him. As he sat next to her, Erdosain found it impossible to keep his hands still, and caressed her forehead with his fingertips.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why are you the way you are?” he asked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita looked at him coolly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stared at her for a moment in mute despair, then reached out for her slender hand. He was about to raise it to his lips when some strange force prevented him doing so. With a sob, he slumped on her lap.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He started weeping uncontrollably as she sat straight-backed, watching his body shaking without any sign of emotion. He wept blindly, his life a knotted ball of hopeless fury; he could not cry out in pain, but choking back the rage only served to increase his dreadful sorrow; suffering poured out of him in endless waves, drowning him as it sobbed from his throat. He broke down in this way for several minutes, biting his handkerchief to keep from screaming, while her silence was a soft cushion for his exhausted spirit. Slowly this intense agony wore itself out; the last tears welled up in his eyes, while his breathing was a confused rattling sound in his chest. He found comfort in being stretched out like this, wetcheeked, on a woman’s lap. He felt completely drained; the figure of his distant wife finally disappeared from the surface of his torment; and as he lay there a twilight calm descended on him, an acceptance of whatever disasters were in store for him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He raised his face, red from the tears and imprinted with the folds of her dress.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She was still eyeing him coolly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’re sad?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They both fell silent as a violet flash of lightning lit the corners of the dark patio outside. It began to rain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Should we have a drink of maté?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He boiled the water without saying anything more. As he poured the maté leaves into the container, she stared absent-mindedly at the rain beating on the windows. Smiling through his tears, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’ll like the way I make it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why were you so sad?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know … a feeling of anguish … I haven’t felt at peace with myself for so long now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was drinking the maté in silence. Hipólita stood out perfectly against a corner of peeling wallpaper, wrapped in her fur coat and with the two bands of her hair covering the tips of her ears.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain smiled a childish grin, and confessed: “When I’m on my own, I drink a lot of maté.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She smiled in a friendly way. She was leaning forward, one leg crossed over the other, elbow cupped in her hand as she sipped slowly through the nickel-plated drinking straw.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I felt at the end of my tether,” Erdosain said again &mdash; “but how cold your hands are! Are they always like that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Can I take your hand?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita straightened up and held it out to him with an almost regal gesture. Erdosain took hold of it gently, then raised it to his lips. She stared at him for a long moment, all the coldness of her eyes melting in a sudden warmth that brought colour to her cheeks. All at once Erdosain remembered the chained-up prisoner, but this did not entirely demolish the pale sense of hope being kindled in him. He said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Listen … if you asked me here and now to kill myself, I would. I’m so happy!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The warmth that an instant earlier had lit the depths of Hipólita’s eyes was snuffed out, replaced once again by her cold gaze. She stared at him intrigued.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m being serious. I’m going to … no. It’s better for you to ask me to kill myself … tell me, don’t you think it would be better if certain people just ceased to exist?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Even though they do terrible things?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s in God’s hands.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then it’s not worth talking about it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Again they sat drinking their maté in silence. This gave him the chance to enjoy the spectacle of this red-headed woman dressed in her fur coat, her transparent hands clasped round the knee of her green silk dress.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Unable to contain his curiosity, he burst out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is it true you were a maid?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes … what’s so strange about that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s odd.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It just is. Sometimes I think I’m going to find what’s missing in my life in someone else’s. I feel that some people have found the secret of happiness … and if they would only tell us that secret, we could be happy too.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But my life is no secret.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you never felt how strange life is?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, of course.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me about it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It was when I was a young girl. I worked in a beautiful house on Alvear Avenue. There were three daughters and four servants. I would wake up in the morning and still could not believe I was the one moving in and out of all this furniture that wasn’t mine, among people who only spoke to me to give orders. Sometimes I felt everyone else was well-anchored in their existence, in their houses, but I was loose, only attached to life by a thread. I heard other people’s voices in my ears like when you’re half-asleep and you’re not sure whether you’re dreaming or it’s real.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That must be really sad.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, it’s sad to see other people happy, to see they don’t understand that you are unhappy and always will be. I remember that when it was time for my afternoon nap I would go to my room and instead of mending my clothes or whatever, I would sit thinking: ‘Am I going to be a maid all my life?’ It wasn’t the work I found tiring, but this constantly going over things in my mind. Have you noticed how sad thoughts refuse to go away?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, that’s true. How old were you then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sixteen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you hadn’t slept with a man?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … but I was angry … angry at the thought of being a maid all my life … and there was one thing that stuck in my mind more than anything else. It was one of the sons. He was engaged to be married, and he was a staunch Catholic. I caught him several times making love to a cousin of his who I now realise must have been his fiancee: she was very sensual, and I always asked myself how he could reconcile his Catholicism with this disgusting way of carrying on. Despite myself, I ended up spying on him … although he was always the perfect gentleman with me, not at all like he was with her. Later on I realised that what I had been looking for was … but by then it was too late … I was already working in another house …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I was still haunted by my obsession. What did I want from life? I hadn’t the slightest idea. Everybody treated me very well. Since then, I’ve heard people do down the rich … but I never saw their cruelty. That’s just how things were. They had no need to be cruel, did they? They were the daughters, and I was the maid.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I remember that one day I was on a tram with one of my employers. Opposite us a pair of young men were chatting. Have you noticed how some days there are certain words which explode in your ears like bombs … as if you had always been deaf and all of a sudden you really hear people speak for the first time? That’s how it was. One of the young men said: ‘If an intelligent woman, no matter how ugly, decided to sell herself, she would get rich and if she was careful not to fall in love with anyone, she could rule a whole city. If I had a sister, that’s what I’d tell her.’ His words made me freeze in my seat. They drove away all my shyness, so that by the time we got off the tram I felt it was not someone else who had spoken these fateful words, but me, although I had forgotten them until that moment. For days after that, I was troubled by the problem of how one actually goes about selling oneself.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain smiled: “That’s amazing!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I spent my first month’s wages on buying books to try to find out. That was a mistake, because almost all of them were stupid, pornographic books … they weren’t about selling yourself, but the sadness of pleasure … And, believe it or not, none of my friends could explain to me properly what it meant.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Go on … I’m not surprised that Ergueta fell in love with you. You are an extraordinary woman.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita blushed with pleasure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t exaggerate … I have common sense, that’s all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me more, delicious creature.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What a child you are! Well then …” &mdash; Hipólita pulled the lapels of her coat across her chest, and went on &mdash; “I was working the whole day as before, but the work seemed increasingly strange to me … I mean that while I was scrubbing or making a bed, my thoughts were far away, or buried so deep inside that sometimes I got the feeling that if they got any bigger they would burst through my skin. But still I couldn’t solve my problem. I wrote to a bookshop asking if they could sell me a manual on how a woman should sell herself, but I had no reply. Then one day I decided to see a lawyer about it. I went to the court district, and looked at plaque after plaque until finally I came to Juncal, where I stopped in front of a fine building. I talked to the doorman, and he took me up to see a qualified lawyer. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. He was a thin, serious-looking man who looked like a wicked bandit, but he had the smile of a little kid. Thinking it over afterwards, I decided he must be someone who suffered a lot.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She sipped the maté, then gave him back the gourd, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s so hot in here! Couldn’t you open the door?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain half-opened one side of it. It was still raining. Hipólita went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I didn’t hesitate, but told him straight out: ‘I’ve come to see you because I want to know how a woman goes about prostituting herself.’ He sat staring at me in amazement. After a few moments, he asked: ‘For what reason do you wish to know this?’ I calmly explained my reasons, and he listened carefully, frowning and pondering on what I was saying. Eventually he said: ‘For a woman, selling her body means to engage in sexual acts without love and for money.’ ‘You mean,’ I replied, ‘that by selling your body you can free yourself from it … you can be free.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what you told him?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s so remarkable!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I left his office almost without a word of goodbye. I was happier than I had ever been before. To sell your body, Erdosain, that meant freeing yourself of it, having your mind and will free to achieve whatever you wanted. I felt so happy that when a nice-looking young guy came past and propositioned me, I went with him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I got such a surprise! Once the man … I’ve already told you he was a good-looking young fellow … once he had had his fill, he collapsed like a pole-axed steer. At first I thought he must have been taken ill &mdash; I never imagined anything like that. But once he’d explained to me it was natural in men, I couldn’t stop myself laughing. So men, who seem as strong as bulls … well! D’you remember that story about the thief in a room full of gold? At that moment I, the maid, was the thief in the room full of gold. I realised the world was mine … afterwards, before I became a real prostitute, I decided to study everything about it … yes, don’t look so surprised, I read all I could get my hands on … from all the novels I read, I came to the conclusion that men thought educated women had extraordinary powers of love … I don’t know if I’m making sense … what I mean is that culture was simply a veneer to increase the value of the goods for sale.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did you ever enjoy being possessed?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, but to return to what I was saying: I read everything.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain felt a wave of sympathy for her uncompromising attitude, and said softly: “Would you give me your hand?” She did so, gravely. He took it gently, and raised it to his lips. She stared at him in silence, but Remo suddenly remembered the chained-up prisoner, who by now must be awake in the stables. This image could not dispel the gentle sweetness lulling his senses, and he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Look, if you … if you were to ask me to kill myself here and now, I’d do it with pleasure.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She stared at him through her red eyelashes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m being serious. Tomorrow … today … it’s better … ask me to kill myself … tell me, don’t you think it’s better if certain people just cease to exist?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, that isn’t right.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Even though they become criminals?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who can judge another person?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then there’s no more to be said.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He drank the maté in silence as before. Erdosain suddenly saw how sweet many things could be. He stared at her, then said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What an extraordinary creature you are!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She smiled with pleasure, and his soul rejoiced.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Shall I make some more?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita stared at him solemn-eyed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where did you get that soul of yours?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was about to tell her of all he had suffered, but a sense of shame held him back. Instead, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know … I’ve often thought about purity … I would have liked to be a pure man …” &mdash; then, warming to his words &mdash; “I’ve often felt sad at not being one. Why? I’ve no idea. But can you picture a man with a spotless soul falling in love for the first time? And for everyone to be the same? Can you imagine how great the love must be between a pure woman and a pure man? Before they gave themselves to one another, they would kill themselves … or rather, she would give herself to him … and then the two would commit suicide, knowing it was pointless to live without hope.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But that’s impossible.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And yet it does happen. Haven’t you seen how many shopkeepers and seamstresses commit suicide together? They are in love … but cannot marry … they go to a hotel … she gives herself to him, then they kill themselves.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, but they do it without knowing what they’re doing.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Maybe.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Where did you eat last night?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain told her about the Espila family, explaining how they had fallen into abject poverty.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why don’t they work?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How are they supposed to? They’re always looking for work, but there is none. That’s the worst of it. It seems to me that misery has destroyed their will to live. Eustaquio &mdash; he’s the deaf one &mdash; has a great talent for mathematics … he can do infinitesimal calculus; and yet it’s no use to him. He also knows ‘Don Quixote’ by heart … although there is something not quite right about him … I’ll just give you one example: when he was sixteen they sent him to buy some maté tea and instead of going to a grocer’s store he went to a chemist’s. After a lot of arguing, he said it was because maté is a medicinal herb … he’d studied it in botany.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You mean he has no common sense.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right. And he’s also a serious gambler … and he’s capable of going without his supper just to solve a riddle. Whenever he has a few cents he goes down to the shops and stuffs himself with cakes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He sounds weird!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Emilio, though, is a good sort. He’s convinced … he told me so himself … that their strange lack of will is because of hereditary reasons, and that thought dominates his life &mdash; he moves about as slowly as a tortoise. He can take two hours to get dressed: it’s as if everything he does throws him into a state of total indecision.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about the two sisters?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The poor things do what they can … they sew … one of them looks after a friend’s hydrocephalic boy &mdash; his head is swollen as big as a melon.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How terrible!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What I don’t understand is how they came to accept all that. That’s why after I’d seen them in their hovel I was determined to give them some hope … and since I’m a good talker, I managed to convince them. Now they’re all enthusiastic about my copper rose.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain explained his talents as an inventor. It had all started soon after his marriage, when he dreamt at night of discovering something that would make him rich. His imagination filled the night with extraordinary machines, huge blocks of machinery turning on their greased cogwheels …</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’re an inventor?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … not any more … but it used to be important to me. I used to be hungry, terribly hungry for money … maybe I was crazy in a way I no longer am … when I mentioned the copper rose to the Espilas, it wasn’t because of the money I might make, but because I needed to offer them some hope; I needed to see with my own eyes how those two poor girls dreamt of silk dresses, of handsome boyfriends, of a car at the door of a mansion they would never own. And now I’m convinced they believe every word.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Have you always been this way?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, only sometimes. Have you never felt the urge to perform works of charity? I can remember this other instance. I’m telling you this because you asked me what kind of soul I have. I remember now. It was a year ago. It was at two o’clock early one Saturday morning. I remember I was feeling sad and went into a brothel. The salon was full of people waiting their turn. All at once the bedroom door opened and the girl appeared … just picture it … she had the round face of a sixteen-year-old … bright blue eyes and a schoolgirl’s smile. She was wearing a green robe and was quite tall … but she had the face of a schoolgirl … She looked round, but it was too late … a ghastly negro with coal-black lips stood up, and so after giving the rest of us a look that offered a promise, she went sadly back inside while the madam glared at her.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain paused for a moment and then, with a clearer, slower voice, went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Waiting in a brothel like that fills you with shame, believe me. There’s nothing sadder than to be there, surrounded by pale faces trying to hide their dreadful lust beneath false, evasive smiles. And there’s something even more humiliating … it’s hard to say what it is … but time rushes through your ears, and you can’t help hearing a bed creaking inside, then a silence, and later, the sound of the washbasin … But before anyone else could sit in the black man’s seat, I got up and sat there. I waited with my heart pounding, and when the girl appeared in the doorway I stood up.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s how it always is … one after the other.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I stood up and went in. The door closed behind me; I left the money on the washstand, but when the girl started to open her robe, I took her by the arm and told her: ‘No, I haven’t come here to do that.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain’s voice had taken on a warm glow.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“She stared at me, and it was obvious she must be thinking I was some kind of pervert; but I looked at her with only pity in my eyes, believe me, and I said: ‘Look, I came in here because I felt sorry for you.’ By now we were sitting next to a dresser with a gilded mirror on it, and she was scrutinising my face. How I remember! As if it were happening right now. I said to her: ‘Yes, I felt sorry for you. I know you must earn two or three thousand pesos a month … and that there are families who would be delighted to live on what you splash out on shoes … I know that … but I felt sorry for you, so sorry, when I saw how you were destroying all that’s good in you.’ She stared at me silently, but there was no smell of wine on me. ‘So then I thought … as soon as that black guy came in, I thought I should leave you something nice … and the nicest thing I could think of leaving you was this … to come in but not to touch you … so that you’ll always remember my gesture.’ While I was talking, the girl’s robe fell open, revealing her breasts, and above her knee … all of a sudden, she saw in the mirror what had happened, and quickly smoothed the robe down over her knees and covered her chest. Her gesture had a strange effect on me … she was looking at me without saying a word … heaven knows what she was thinking … then the madam rapped on the door, she glanced towards it in dismay, and turned back to look at me … stared at me for a moment … stood up, took the five pesos and tried to stuff them back into my pocket. She said: ‘Don’t come here again, or I’ll have the doorman throw you out.’ Both of us were standing … I was about to leave by the other door, when I felt her put her arms round my neck … she was staring me in the face, and kissed me on the mouth … how can I possibly describe that kiss? … she drew her hand across my forehead and as I was stepping out of the door, called after me: ‘Good-bye, noble-hearted man.’”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And you never went back?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, but I still hope that one day I’ll meet her … who knows where … but I’m sure she, Lucienne, will never forget me. Time will go by, she’ll end up in the foulest brothels … turn into a monster … but I’ll always be with her just as I had hoped, as the most precious memory in her life.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rain was beating on the door-panes and on to the patio tiles. Erdosain was slowly sipping his maté. Hipólita stood up, went over to the door and stood looking out at the darkened yard. Then she turned back to him and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re a strange man, d’you know that?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain hesitated for a moment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ll be honest with you … I don’t know what’ll become of my life … but believe me, it was not in my power to be a good man. Dark forces pulled me away … dragged me down.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What now?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now I’m trying an experiment. I met a genius of a man who’s firmly convinced that lies are the basis of human happiness, and I’ve decided to throw in my lot with him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And does that make you happy?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … for a long time now I’ve felt I can never be happy again.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But don’t you believe in love?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t even mention that!” But then suddenly he realised what the point had been of all his confused attempts to explain, and said: “What would you think of me if tomorrow … or some day … if some day you learnt I had killed a man?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita had sat down again. Leaning her head against the sofa back, she looked up at him slowly, that cold look of hers spreading once more from behind her red eyelashes. She said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’d think you were a tremendously unhappy man.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain got up from his chair, put away the burner, the maté tea and the gourd in the wardrobe drawer. Hipólita said: “Come here … lie at my feet.” He felt an enormous sweetness inside him. He sat on the carpet, leaning against her legs, and let his head drop into her lap. Hipólita closed her eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He felt wonderful. He was curled up in her lap, and could feel the warmth of her body on his cheek through her dress. It all seemed so natural to him: just as he had always wished, life had become like the cinema; and it never occurred to him in the slightest that Hipólita, sitting stiffly on the sofa, was thinking how weak and sentimental he was … in the pauses of its movement, the ticking of the clock let fall a drop of sound that dripped like water into the room’s hollow silence. Hipólita said to herself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He’ll spend all his life whining and suffering. What good’s a man like that to me? I’d have to keep him. And I bet the copper rose is so much junk. What woman is going to want to wear heavy metal ornaments on her hat, especially if they turn black? That’s how all men are. The weak ones are intelligent but useless; the others are brutes and a bore. I’ve never found one capable of slashing all the others’ throats, or of becoming a dictator. They make me sick.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She increasingly thought this way, as reality tore to shreds the phantoms her imagination briefly dressed in bright colours. She could point them all out. The stiff rag doll, perfumed and stern as he went about his business, priding himself on being so grave and silent, was a lascivious cretin underneath; the small, well-mannered one, always so kind, discreet and sensible, was a slave to the most atrocious perversions; the other one, as violent as a haulier and as strong as an ox, was as clumsy as a schoolboy … so they all filed past her, all linked by that same, unquenchable desire: and all of them had at one time or another let their weary heads droop on to her bare knees; and all the time she put up with their clumsy hands, the fleeting desires that stiffened these sad dummies, she thought of life as having to go thirsty in the midst of a desert.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">That’s how life was. Men were only moved to act by hunger, lust or money. That’s how life was.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In despair, she even came to think that the only man who really interested her was the pharmacist. He at least had been able to rise for a few moments above the dreadful call of the flesh; but the lure of gambling had broken his mechanism, and now he lay even more in pieces than any of the other dolls.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What a life she had led! In her youth, when she had been a destitute young girl, she had known she would never have any money, nor a house filled with beautiful furniture, nor gleaming china services … and that impossibility had made her as sad then as she was now in the knowledge that none of the men she might seduce had it in him to be a dictator or a conqueror of new lands.</div>

     INNER LIFE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">What dreams she had dreamt!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Some days she dreamt of a sensational encounter with a man whose talk would be of jungles and who kept a pet lion in his house. He would be a tireless lover, and she would worship him like a slave; she would take pleasure in shaving her armpits for him, or painting her breasts. Disguised as a boy, she would accompany him to ruins where giant centipedes lurk, to places where black tribes built huts in the forks of trees. But Hipólita had never found her lions, only flearidden dogs, and the most adventurous men she had met were bar-counter heroes, mystics worried about their next meal. She fled their petty lives in disgust.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As time went by, the few people she met who could have been characters from a novel proved to be less interesting than she had imagined, precisely because what made them stand out in the novel were the revolting characteristics that made them unbearable in real life. Yet she gave herself to them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Once they were satisfied, they soon left her, as though ashamed of allowing her to see their weakness. From then on, she sank into the sterile wastes of her life as if she were wandering through a familiar desert of sand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was as impossible to transform men’s souls as it was to turn lead into gold.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">How often had she collapsed naked into the arms of a stranger and whispered to him: “Wouldn’t you like to go to Africa?” At this, the man would leap up as if he had been lying next to a rattlesnake. Hipólita ended up feeling that these bodies, with their muscles and their splendid bone structures, were in fact weaker than little children, more frightened than the babes in the wood.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At the same time, she detested women. She saw how everywhere they prostrated themselves beneath male passion, then went around displaying their hideously swollen bellies. They seemed born to suffer: they were a race of tired people, sleepwalking phantoms that reeked of the earth in their gravid somnolence, like huge slow-moving monsters from prehistoric times. To see them all weighed down in shackles like that crushed her soaring soul. Hipólita would have liked to live in a less dense universe, one as light as a soap bubble, defying gravity. She imagined how happy she would be if she could skip along all the paths of the world changed to suit her desire, if she could turn each passing day into a game that would make up for all those she had never played in her childhood.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When she was little, everything had been denied her. She recalled that as a child, one of her fondest dreams had been that if only she could have wallpaper in her room she would be happy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In hardware stores she had seen rolls of wallpaper that &mdash; to her impoverished imagination &mdash; looked like a guarantee of bliss for anyone who surrounded themselves with it; wallpaper that was like bringing the enchanted wood to a house, with its whorling, fantastic blue flowers on golden backgrounds. This seven-year-old dream was every bit as intense as the illusion when she was a maid that happiness would come from owning a Rolls-Royce. Its leather upholstery was no more precious in her mind than the equally impossible wallpaper at sixty cents a roll.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Her mind strayed to former times. Sitting with Erdosain’s head on her lap, she remembered Sunday afternoons when the sky suddenly turned stormy and a gust of cold wind sent the family scurrying in from the garden to the drawing-room. The rain would beat on the window-panes as she sought refuge in the gleaming, spotless kitchen, the voices of the visitors reaching her from distant rooms as the women chattered and the young girls leafed through magazines, pausing to look at the photos of society weddings, or played the piano.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She meanwhile sat at her table twisting the tip of her apron in her fingers, bending forward to catch the sounds, which always seemed sad to her even when they were talking of pleasurable topics. She felt as excluded as a leper from happiness. The piano music brought her images of different worlds, of mountain hotels, where she would never be the newly-wed who came down on the arm of her handsome spouse to dinner, with its warm chink of china, and birds fluttering outside windows that gave on to a splendid waterfall. Legs crossed, she twisted the tip of her apron between her fingers, head down as she listened.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She would never have a husband like Marcelo in a popular novel, nor spread her shawl over the velvet hand-rail of an opera box, while diamonds glittered in duchesses’ ears, and violins scraped softly in the orchestra pit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Nor would she ever be one of those young married women she was used to serving, women tenderly spoilt by their husbands as pregnancy swelled their aching stomachs. And sorrow spread through Hipólita like darkness through the twilight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“To be a servant … always a servant!” At this, her anguish became tinged with anger: her brow felt heavy, her red eyelashes closed in resignation.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Sounds of the piano from the drawing-room took her dreamy imagination through a succession of countries; Hipólita imagined that the young ladies’ education must make their minds more beautiful and desirable for their suitors. Her head was as heavy as if her skull had become a helmet of lead bones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Everything around her, from the pots and the stove, the spotless kitchen shelves to the bathroom mirrors or the red lampshades, seemed to her so valuable she would never be able to afford anything like them; everything, from dishcloths to carpets to the children’s tricycles, seemed to her to be there to bring happiness to people made from some different stuff.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She even thought the girls’ clothes, the fine materials they used to adorn their precious bodies with, their lace and their ribbons, must be totally different from whatever she was able to buy for the same money. This feeling of living for a short while with people who inhabited a world separate from her own left her in dismay, to the point where despair was as plain as a blotch on her face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">What could she possibly be except a servant, always a servant!</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An obscure refusal gradually took shape in her heart, a response to the invisible phantom that was consuming her with rage. Her life became one long resistance to domesticity. She did not know how she was going to escape from this chain of unhappiness, but she never failed to tell herself that this was only a passing phase, even though she had no idea what was going to become of her. She spent days observing the way the girls of the house behaved; she studied the way they moved their heads, how they said goodbye to their friends at the door; later on in front of her mirror she imitated what she remembered of their gestures. And for a few short hours, these imitations in her cramped lonely room left on her lips and in her mind the sensation of being one of them, of being every bit as precious as they were &mdash; so that she rejected her own previous clumsy way of being, as if she had grown out of it now she had assumed her true personality as a refined young lady.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So for a few hours her life took on the delicate, penetrating softness of a vanilla-flavoured cream; she almost felt the melodious sounds of the “yeses” and “noes” in her own throat, to the point where she imagined herself replying to a delightful companion wearing a blue fox fur round her neck.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Her maid’s room was filled with elusive phantoms. Seated in a chair lined with alligator silk, she received friends who had come to say goodbye before a trip to “Paris, France” and talked endlessly about boyfriends. “Her mother wouldn’t allow her to spend her summer holidays with X … because they would be sure to run into S … that gossip who was courting her too assiduously.” Or she saw herself crossing the ocean, which was as flat and calm as the lakes in Palermo Park, sitting in a wicker chair just like the ones she had seen in the photos of the luxury liners, when in reality she was crossing the street to buy groceries at the market. She would be sitting with a Kodak on her lap while a young man would have come, cap in hand, to bow and talk timidly to her.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Her maid’s soul was overflowing with happiness. She thought it must be so wonderful, that if only she had been rich in this way her charity would have been boundless. She pictured herself on a dark winter’s evening scurrying along a miserable street, wrapped in her squirrel coat, to meet an orphan girl, the daughter of a poor blind man. She helped raise her, adopted her as her own daughter, until eventually she came out in society, by now a radiant young beauty, bare shoulders rising out of a frenzy of organdie, while across her clear brow a lock of golden hair perfectly set off the delicate curve of her almond eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Just then a voice called out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Hipólita … serve the tea, would you?”</div>

     A CRIME <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain suddenly lifted his head and Hipólita said, as if she had been thinking of him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You too … you were unhappy too, weren’t you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain took her cold hand and brushed it against his lips.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">She went on slowly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sometimes life seems like a bad dream. Now I feel I am yours, the heartbreak from earlier times comes flooding back. Always, everywhere, there is suffering.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then she said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What do we have to do not to suffer?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The problem is, we carry it around inside us. I used to think it was outside, floating in the air … but that was ridiculous: the fact is, unhappiness is within us.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They fell silent. Hipólita was softly stroking his hair, then all at once took her hand from his head and Erdosain felt it pressed against his lips.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He got up and sat beside her, murmuring:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me, what have I done for you to make me so happy? Don’t you see you’ve brought heaven within my grasp? I was feeling so bad before …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Has no-one ever loved you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I don’t know; but I’d never seen the terrible passion of love. I was twenty when I married, and believed in it as pure spirituality.” He hesitated for a moment, but then got up, blew out the lamp, and sat down on the sofa next to Hipólita. He said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Maybe I was a fool. Before we were married, I hadn’t even kissed my wife. I’d never felt the urge to do so, because I mistook the coldness of her feelings for purity … because I thought one should not kiss a decent young woman.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita smiled in the darkness. By now, Erdosain was perched on the edge of the sofa, his elbows digging into his knees, his chin cupped in his hands.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A violet lightning flash lit the room fleetingly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went on slowly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“To me, a well brought-up young woman was the true expression of purity. And also … don’t laugh … I was shy … on our wedding night, when she got undressed quite naturally with the light on, I turned my head away, embarrassed … and I got into bed with my trousers on …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You did that?” Hipólita’s voice trembled with indignation.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain began to laugh excitedly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why not?” He started rubbing his hands, glancing at her out of the corner of his eye. “I’ve done that and a lot worse. Not to mention what I will do … ‘The time is at hand,’ your husband used to say. I think he was right. Of course the things I mentioned were from a period in my life when I behaved like an idiot. I’m telling you this so you can be sure that if I did sleep with you I wouldn’t keep my trousers on …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita was suddenly anxious. Erdosain kept on glancing at her out of the corner of his eye, rubbing his hands all the time. She said cautiously:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You must have been ill. Like me when I was a maid. You weren’t in your element.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right, not in my element … exactly that. I remember when people called me an idiot.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You too?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, to my face … I would stand there staring at whoever insulted me, and while all my muscles relaxed and went loose, I asked myself what I had done, at any time in my life, to allow me to bear so much humiliation and cowardice. I suffered so … so much that I often thought of going and offering myself as a servant in some rich man’s house … How could I suffer any more humiliation? So I felt terrified, a ghastly fear of not having any noble goal to my life, no great dream. But now at last I’ve found one … I’ve condemned a man to death … no, don’t stand up … tomorrow, because I’m not doing anything to stop it, a man will be murdered.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But that’s not possible!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, it is. The man who believes in lies, the one I mentioned to you earlier, needed money to finance his plan. And it will happen, because I want it to. Tomorrow he’s going to give me a cheque to cash. When I do, the condemned man will die.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s not possible!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It is. And what’s more, if I don’t go back, they won’t kill him, because without the money the crime is pointless … it’s 15,000 pesos … I could run off with the money … then his secret society would never happen … and the other man would be saved … d’you follow me? Everything depends on my thief’s honour.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“My God!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I want the experiment to go ahead … isn’t it strange how certain circumstances turn you into a god? For a long time now I’ve been determined to kill myself. If you had said ‘yes’ when I asked you earlier, I would have done it. If you only knew how fine and noble I feel now! Don’t say anything more about the other matter … it’s all settled, and I’m even glad to think of the pit I’m flinging myself into. Can you understand that? And then some day soon … no, it won’t be a day … some night, when I’ve had my fill of all this farce and confusion, I’ll be gone.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A line creased Hipólita’s forehead. There was no doubt about it: the man was mad. Like the adventuress she was, she was already foreseeing future problems, and said to herself: “you’ll have to be careful where this imbecile is concerned”. Folding her arms across her coat, she asked him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But do you have the courage to kill yourself?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s not the point. It’s not about courage or cowardice. I know deep inside that killing oneself is just the same as going to have a tooth pulled. Once I realise that, I feel perfectly calm. It’s true I had thought of other journeys, other lands, another life perhaps. There’s something in me that wants everything that’s fine and beautiful. I’ve often thought that if … say with those 15,000 pesos I get tomorrow … I could go to the Philippines … or to Ecuador to start a new life, marry a gentle young millionairess … we could sleep our siestas in a hammock under the coconut palms, while black waiters bring us slices of orange … and I would gaze sadly out to sea … d’you know something? … this certainty I have that wherever I go I’ll gaze sadly out to sea … this conviction I can never be happy again … at first it drove me wild … but now I’ve got used to it …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So why carry on with the experiment?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why? I feel I still haven’t got to the bottom of myself … this crime is my last hope … and the Astrologer knows that, because when I asked him if he wasn’t afraid I would run off with the money, he answered: ‘No, not for the moment, no … you more than anyone need this to be able to escape from your anxiety …’ So you can see how caught up in it I am.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’d never have dreamt it. They’re going to kill him in Temperley?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes. And yet … Who knows? Anguish! Have you any idea what that means? To feel that anguish has made you rotten to the core like syphilis? Listen, I’ll tell you something that happened four months ago: I was waiting for the train in a country station. It was going to arrive in forty-five minutes, so I walked across to the town square. A few minutes later, a young girl about nine years old came to sit beside me on the bench. We began to talk … she was wearing a white schoolgirl’s apron … she lived in one of the houses opposite … Slowly, unable to control myself, I turned the conversation to an obscene topic … but cautiously, feeling my way. I was obsessed with an appalling sense of curiosity. Hypnotised by some kind of instinct, the child listened to me trembling … while slowly my face took on a criminal look … so that back in the signalmen’s box two railway workers began to watch me closely … but still I revealed to her the mystery of sex, and encouraged her to lead her friends astray …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Hipólita squeezed her temples between her fingers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re nothing but a monster!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now I’ve reached the end. My life is a disaster … I have to create the foulest messes for myself … to commit sin. Don’t look at me. Perhaps … listen: people have forgotten the meaning of the word sin … sin is not simply a mistake … I’ve come to realise that sin is an act by which a man breaks the slender thread still linking him to God. It means God is denied him for ever. Even if after committing the sin that man’s life were purer than the purest saint’s, he could never reach God again. And I’m going to break the slender thread that connected me to divine charity. I know it. As from tomorrow, I’ll be a monster on the face of this earth … just picture it, a little creature … a foetus … a foetus that was somehow living outside its mother’s womb … unable to grow … covered in hair … tiny … with no fingernails … walking among men without being one itself … its fragility horrifying all those around it … and yet there’s no force on earth capable of restoring it to the lost womb. That’s what’s going to happen to me tomorrow. I’ll cut myself off from God for ever. I’ll be alone on this earth. My soul and me, just the two of us. With infinity in front of us. Alone for ever. Night and day … under a yellow sun. Can you picture it? Infinity growing all the time … a yellow sun up above, and the soul which cut itself off from divine charity wandering alone and blind under that yellow sun.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The floor shook with a dull thud, and all of a sudden something extraordinary happened. Aghast, Erdosain fell silent. Hipólita was kneeling at his feet … She took his hand and smothered it with kisses. In the darkness she exclaimed:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Let me … let me kiss your poor hands. You’re the unhappiest man on earth.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Get up, Hipólita. It’s you who have suffered so much! Get up, please, I beg you …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I want to kiss your feet” &mdash; he could feel her arm, clutching his legs &mdash; “You’re the most unfortunate man on earth! How you’ve suffered, dear God! How noble you are … how noble your soul is!”<sup class="calibre15">4</sup></div>
    <div class="paragraph">With infinite tenderness, Erdosain lifted her up. Overwhelmed by a sense of infinite pity, he drew her close to him, smoothed the hair on her brow, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“If you only knew how easy it will be for me to die. Just like a game.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What a noble soul you have!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you have a fever?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Poor boy!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why? We’re like gods. Come and sit beside me. Is that all right? Look, little sister, all my suffering has been erased by your words. We can live a little longer …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Like an engaged couple …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And when the great day arrives, you’ll be my bride.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I love you so much! … What a noble soul!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Then we’ll leave all this behind.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">They said nothing more. Hipólita’s head lay across his chest. It was almost dawn. Erdosain stretched her tired body out on the sofa … she gave an exhausted smile; then he sat down on the rug, leant his head against the edge of the sofa, curled up and fell asleep.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-79" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-36" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897200791152" class="calibre10"></a>
     PRESENCE OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">That same night, reclining on his sofa in his darkened study with his arms folded and his hat down over his eyes, the Astrologer was pondering the problems facing him. He could dimly hear the rain beating on the window-panes, but his mind was fixed on his many plans. And something strange was happening to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As the moment for the crime drew near, he felt a second, personal sense of time growing within the space of normal time. So he felt he existed in both of these times. One was that of all the normal states of life, the other was fleeting but heavy, part of his heartbeats, slipping through his fingers locked in meditation like water out of a reed basket.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So the Astrologer, held within clock time, could feel this other accelerated time speed endlessly through his brain like a cinema film that has slipped and spools out its images, in a blurred, exhausting way that exasperated him, because before he could clearly grasp an idea it had vanished and been replaced by another. So much so that when he lit a match to look at his watch, he found only a few minutes had passed, whereas he had thought that those mechanical minutes, speeded up by his anxiety, had been so long they were immeasurable.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This feeling kept him on the look-out in the dark. He understood that any mistake he made in his current state could be fatal to him later on.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was not so much concerned about Barsut’s murder as about the precautions needed to keep it from assuming too much importance. And even though he was supposed to be working out an alibi, he found it difficult. He felt that the person sitting there in the dark was not him, but his double, someone forged by emotion to his exact same shape, with the same oblong features, folded arms, and hat down over his eyes. But he found himself unable to fathom the thoughts of this double so closely linked to himself, yet so distant from his understanding. At these moments he felt that this sensation of existing had taken over from his mere bodily existence. When he came to explain this feeling later on, he said it was the awareness of the different time-scale that emotions moved in, set inside that other clock time &mdash; like people who say: “that minute seemed like a century”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This inability to think was important because he had to take a man’s life, to stop the circulation of his five litres of blood, to turn all his cells cold, rubbing him out of life like a blot from a piece of paper, leaving no trace behind. Since the Astrologer could not rid himself of such a weighty problem, he sensed that his physical being was part of mechanical, clock time, whereas his double was located in the slowed-down speed of this other time that no clock could measure &mdash; and that this double was also deep in thought, in not just an enigmatic but a truly mysterious way, busy with who knew what alibis that would later take the thinking man completely by surprise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The certainty that the impending crime had transformed him into a twin mechanism with two such different rhythms and pauses left him limp and sombre in the darkness. A terrible weariness overwhelmed his muscles, his powerful limbs, the joints of his bones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rain started up the brief croaking mechanism of the frogs in the ditches, but he, the man of action, pounded by anxiety to the point where he felt all his bones had been flattened until he could not even stand, said to himself: “I, a man of action, am unable to move, stuck in this mechanical measure of time while I am prey to another time I have no control over &mdash; a time which makes me drop my guard. Because while there’s no doubt that killing a man is as simple as slitting a lamb’s throat, that’s not how it seems to others &mdash; and although they are remote, and my behaviour is a mystery to them, this abnormal time draws them closer, so that I can barely move, as if they were all there in the shadows, spying on me. It must be this subconscious time that’s paralysing me, the subconscious Astrologer who’s keeping his ideas to himself, and leaving me as limp as a squeezed orange when it comes to thinking up the ideas I need. And yet, once Barsut is dead, life will go on as if nothing had happened … and the truth is, nothing will have happened, if only this state of mind passes.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He lit another match. Arrowheads of moving shadow flickered round the room. Scarcely a minute had gone by. His thoughts were simultaneous, and swept together in this absence of time facts which, if they had taken place in real time, would have needed months if not years to become apparent. So, he had been born forty-three years and seven days earlier, but this past was constantly being swallowed up by the present, which itself was so fleeting it was always the Astrologer of the next minute who was being consumed in the instant. Now his life was pointed towards an action that did not as yet exist but which in a few hours would be a fact; it was as if he were a bow drawn back within mechanical time, a bow whose primed violence conveyed a dim sense of its extraordinary tension to that ordinary clock time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Despite the fact that he had always said that if he had the chance to kill someone he would not miss the opportunity, he still found himself worrying about this mysterious other time. Then he began to imagine a dictatorship which would keep itself in power through terror imposed by a whole series of executions; picturing all the people shot as horizontal corpses helped him escape from his fears of the moment. He conjured up the image of a tiny man stretched out in the midst of a huge plain, and comparing the length of this dead body with the thousands of kilometres he ruled over, he convinced himself that the life of one man was insignificant.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">So the man would rot underground, while he, rid of this human obstacle that measured less than a tiny fraction of the lands he controlled, would go on to further glorious conquests.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then he thought of Lenin rubbing his hands and telling the Soviet commissars: “This is madness. How can we make a revolution if we don’t shoot anyone?” The Astrologer’s heart leapt for joy. He would make sure his society adopted the same principle. The future founders of races would be instilled with this strict political discipline; the thought gave him fresh impetus. Then it occurred to him that any innovator has to struggle against outmoded ideas that form part of his own make-up, and he saw that all his current hesitations were a result of a conflict between principles yet to impose themselves and those already established.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Time slipped through his fingers, clasped together in thought.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Today’s murderer would be tomorrow’s conqueror, but in the meantime he had to put up with the sordid resistance of a present mixed with all it contained of the past. He stood up, feeling angry. It was still raining. He went out to the front steps, and stood there staring out into the darkened garden, where the slow, heavy rainfall was making the trees and shrubs quiver. It seemed as though the dark shadows were a monster panting heavily in the black night. The soaked earth had turned a dark ochre colour … and there he was, a strong man in the night, the driving force for great events, and yet no phantom rose out of the darkness to confirm his presence. He wondered whether men in earlier times had been so indecisive, or if they had marched off to their destinies happy in the knowledge that death was sufficient armour for their struggle. Was death that important, though? He told himself that as a philosophical being all that could possibly interest him was the species, not the individual; but at the same time his feelings were assailing him with doubts, splitting the time he needed into two against his will.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A flash of lightning drove blue distances between the mountainous banks of cloud. Soaking and dishevelled, the Man Who Saw the Midwife was standing beside the steps.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, it’s you!” the Astrologer gasped.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I wanted to ask how you interpret the verse from the Bible that says: ‘the heaven of God’. Surely that means there are other heavens not of God’s making …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Whose are they then?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I mean, it could be that there are heavens where God does not exist. Because the verse goes on: ‘And the new Jerusalem will descend.’ The new Jerusalem? Does that mean the new church?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer thought for a moment. He wasn’t interested in the matter, but he knew that to keep his prestige in the other man’s eyes he would have to say something, so he replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We, the enlightened ones, secretly know that the new Jerusalem is the new church. That’s why Swedenborg says: ‘Since our Lord cannot show himself in person, and given that he has announced that he will come and establish a new church, it follows that he will do this by means of a man, who not only will receive the doctrine of this church but will publish it in the press …’ But why from just this one reference do you assume that there must be various heavens?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Bromberg came and sheltered under the porch. He stared out at the wet, panting darkness and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Because heavens are something you feel, like love.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stared at him in surprise, but the Jew went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s like love. How can you deny love if it’s inside you and you feel the angels making it stronger all the time? It’s the same with the four heavens. Everything in the Bible is a mystery, of course, otherwise the book would be completely absurd. The other night I was reading the Book of Revelation. I was sad at the thought we had to kill Barsut, and wondered if it was permitted to shed human blood.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s no blood shed when you strangle someone,” the Astrologer observed wryly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And when I got to the part speaking of the ‘heaven of God’ I understood why mankind was so sad. God’s heaven had been denied it by the church of darkness … and that’s why men have sinned so much.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the darkness, Bromberg’s childish voice sounded as mournful as if he were lamenting being cast out of the true heaven. The Astrologer put in:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The winged man who speaks to me in my dreams has told me that the end of the church of darkness is nigh …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That must be true … because hell is growing day by day. So few people are saved that compared to hell, heaven is the size of a grain of sand next to the ocean. Hell grows year after year, and the church of darkness which should have saved mankind only swells its numbers; so hell grows and grows, with no chance of ever shrinking. And the angels look on in fear at the church of darkness and the fiery hell that is swollen like the belly of a dropsy victim.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer answered, in a lofty tone:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s why the winged man told me, ‘Go, holy man, to enlighten mankind and preach the good news. Drive out the antiChrist and reveal the secrets of the new Jerusalem to Bromberg’” &mdash; at this, he seized his companion by the arm and said &mdash; “Don’t you remember when your spirit talked to angels and you served them white bread at the roadside, then sat them on your doorstep and washed their feet?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I don’t remember.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Well, you should. What will the Lord say when he hears that? How will I vouch for your soul to the angel of the new church? He’ll say to me: ‘What has become of my beloved son, my pious Alfon?’ And what will I say to him? That you’re a craven swine. That you have forgotten the times when you led an angelic existence, and that now you spend the whole day in a corner breaking wind like a mule.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Mortally offended, Bromberg objected:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I do not break wind.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, you do, and noisily too … but that doesn’t matter … the angel of the new church knows your spirit burns with true devotion, and that you are the sworn enemy of the King of Babylon, the Pope of darkness. That is why you have been chosen to be a friend of he who following the Lord’s command will establish the new church on this earth.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rain fell softly on the leaves of the fig trees; all the acrid, soft darkness released a damp smell of vegetation into the heaving shadows. Bromberg prophesied gravely:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And the Pope, the Pope himself will run barefoot into the street in horror, and everyone will flee from him, while along the roads arches will be garlanded with flowers to honour the Holy Lamb as he passes by.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That is how it will be,” the Astrologer agreed. “And heaven will open to reveal all the repentant sinners and the golden gates of the new Jerusalem. God’s charity is so boundless, my beloved Alfon, that no man may come into direct contact with it without first falling to the ground, their bones turned to mush.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s why I want to share my view of the Apocalypse with mankind, then head for the mountains to do penance and pray for them all.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right, Alfon, but go to bed now, because I have to think, and it’s time for the winged man to come to whisper in my ear. You have to sleep too, because otherwise you won’t be strong enough to strangle the criminal in the morning …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“&mdash; and the King of Babylon.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s right.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Man Who Saw the Midwife slowly moved away from the steps. The Astrologer went back into the house, climbed a staircase that rose from one side of the hallway, and found himself in a long, narrow room with bare rafters beneath the tiles of the sloping roof.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There were no pictures on the flaking walls. Barsut’s trunks were in one corner, while under a round bull’s eye window stood a red-painted wooden bed. A black bedspread clashed with the white sheets. The Astrologer sat on the edge of the bed deep in thought. His coat fell open, revealing his naked, hairy chest. He stroked his drooping moustache with open fingers, then sat staring with a frown at one of the trunks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He wanted to project his thought on to something new outside himself that would break up the rhythm of his feelings and help him rediscover the presence of mind he had prided himself on before the plan to murder Barsut had complicated things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Twenty thousand pesos” &mdash; he thought &mdash; “twenty thousand pesos to set up the brothels and our training camp … our camp …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But he still could not think clearly. Ideas slipped away from him like shadows; in his permanently divided state, his thoughts spooled out, making it impossible to concentrate. Then all of a sudden the Astrologer slapped himself on the forehead and jubilantly went into the adjoining loft and dragged out a loosely fastened old trunk, which gave off a thick cloud of dust.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Unconcerned about getting this all over his coatsleeves, he opened the box. Inside was a jumble of lead soldiers, wooden dolls, a heap of clowns, toy generals, princesses and strange fat monsters with chipped lips and frog’s mouths.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He took out a piece of rope and tied it to two nails across one of the corners of the room. Then he fished several puppets out of the box and threw them on to the bed. He tied a piece of string round the neck of each of them; he was so absorbed in his work he did not even notice that as the rain fell harder and harder, the wind was blowing it in through the half-open window.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was enjoying himself. He finished tying the strings round the puppets’ necks, then cut them into different lengths, went over to the corner, and hung the dolls from the rope. When he had finished, he stood back to stare at his creation. The five hanged dolls threw hooded, quivering shadows on to the pink wall. The highest was a harlequin who had lost his trousers but still had his black-and-white checked jacket. The next was an idol with chocolate-coloured skin and scarlet lips, whose watermelon head was level with the harlequin’s feet; the third was a clockwork pierrot, with a bronze disc on his stomach and a monkey’s face; the fourth was a blue cardboard sailor; fifth and last came a black puppet which had lost his nose and showed a plaster wound in the white expanse of his stiff cravated neck. The Astrologer stood back to consider his work. His back was to the lamp, and his huge dark shadow rose to the ceiling. He shouted out loud:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You, harlequin, are Erdosain; you, big fellah, are the Gold Prospector; you, clown, are the Thug; and you, black man, are Alfon. Everyone agreed?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His speech over, he pulled Barsut’s trunk away from the wall, set it in front of the puppets and sat looking at them. Then a silent dialogue began, with the Astrologer asking the questions and receiving the replies inside him whenever he looked directly at one of the figures.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">This helped make his thoughts crystal-clear. He needed to express his ideas in this staccato telegraphic form, without interruption, as if everything about him had to keep up with the emotional turmoil he felt deep inside.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">These were his thoughts:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Important: set up poison gas factories. Get the chemicals. For the cells, not cars, but trucks. Solid tyres. Training camp in mountains, nonsense. Or no. Yes. No. Also, factory on banks of River Parana. Cars with nickel steel armour plating. Poison gases important. Revolution breaks out in Chaco and in mountains. Kill brothel owners. Gang of murderers in aeroplane. Everything possible. Radio-telegraph for each cell. Changeable code and wavelength. Electric current from flow of water. Swedish turbines. Erdosain is right. Life is limitless. Who am I? Lab for bubonic bacillae and contagious typhus. Set up academy comparative studies French and Russian revolutions. Also school revolutionary propaganda. Cinema important element. Note: see film-maker. Get Erdosain to study it. Film-maker devoted to revolutionary propaganda. That’s it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rhythm of his thoughts slowed down. He said to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How to instil in everyone’s mind the same revolutionary fervour I feel? Yes, yes! What lie or truth to use? How quickly time rushes by! And how sad! Because it’s true; there’s so much sadness in me, they would all be amazed if they knew. And it’s me who has to keep the whole thing going.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He curled up on the sofa. He was cold. The veins at his temples throbbed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Time slipping away. Yes. Yes. And all of them as heavy as sacks of potatoes. Not one who wants to fly. How can I convince those donkeys they have to fly? True life is different; different from anything they have ever dreamt of. The soul like an ocean crashing inside seventy kilos of flesh. That same flesh that wants to fly. Everything within us yearning to reach the clouds, to make castles in the sky a reality … but how to do it? There’s always that ‘how’, and me … me here, suffering for them, loving them as if I had given birth to them, because I do love those men … I love them all. They’re here on this earth for no particular reason, but they could be so different. And yet I love them. I’m sure of it now. I love all humanity. I love them as if they were all attached to my heart by a fine thread. And they suck out my blood, my life, and in spite of it all there’s so much life left in me that I’d like there to be millions more of them so I could love them even more, and offer them my life. Yes, offer it them like a cigarette. Now I understand Christ. How he must have loved humanity! And yet, I am ugly. My huge fat face is ugly. I should be beautiful like a god. But I have a cauliflower ear, and a bony boxer’s nose. But what does that matter? I’m a man and that’s enough. And I need to conquer. That’s all there is to it. I wouldn’t give up a single one of my thoughts for the love of the most beautiful woman.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All of a sudden some earlier words of his crept into his mind. The Astrologer said to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why not? … We could make cannons, just like Erdosain says. It’s an easy enough process. Besides, they won’t need to be fired a thousand times. Any revolution which took that long would be a failure.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He has run out of words. In the darkness the interior of his skull is filled with the image of a gloomy passage-way with beams holding up the sides of a corrugated iron shed; at the centre, among clouds of coal dust, rise the blast furnaces, their cooling systems like monstrous armour plating. Tongues of fire leap from the reinforced furnace mouths, while outside thick, impenetrable jungle stretches into the distance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer feels he has regained his personality from the strange double time that stole it from him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He is thinking it would be possible to make chrome-plated steel and recoiling guns. Why not? His thoughts glide agilely now over the possible problems. With the money they earn from the brothels, they can buy plots of land all over Argentina for next to nothing. There the society members could build reinforced concrete emplacements for the artillery, disguising them as grain silos.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He is excited by the idea of creating a revolutionary army throughout the country, which would rise up on a radio signal from him. Why not? Steel, chrome, nickel. The words echo in his brain like a spell. Steel, chrome, nickel. Each cell leader would be in charge of an artillery battery. What was essential? For their cannon to fire four or five hundred shells. And machine guns mounted on trucks. Why not? For every ten men a machine gun, a truck, a cannon. Why not give it a try?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Slowly, deep in the dark night, a giant white-hot steel egg supported on two struts lifts its tip up to the roof. This is the Bessemer converter operated by a hydraulic piston. A stream of sparks and flames pours out of the end of the egg. This is the iron being converted into steel thanks to a jet of air blasted through it at hundreds of pounds’ pressure. Steel, chrome, nickel. Why not give it a try? His thoughts focus on a hundred details. A little earlier, the voice inside him had asked:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why is it that there’s so little room for human happiness?” This truth makes him sad. The world should be for the few. And those few should stride out like giants.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">First create a complicated situation. Then resolve it with clear thought. First, kill Barsut, then set up the brothel, the training camp in the mountains … but how would they get rid of the body? Wasn’t it stupid for someone like him, who found it so simple to make a cannon or manufacture steel, chrome and nickel, to find it so hard to dispose of a single dead body? He shouldn’t waste so much time thinking about it … they can burn it … 500 degrees should be enough to destroy a body in a container. Five hundred degrees.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Time and weariness are gradually taking over his mind. He would like not to think, but suddenly the voice from inside, the one separate from his own voice and will, whispers more suggestions to him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“The revolutionary movement will rise up simultaneously in every town in Argentina. We’ll attack every barracks. We’ll start by shooting all those who might cause trouble. A few days beforehand, we’ll release some kilos of typhus and bubonic plague in the capital. From aeroplanes at night. Each cell on the outskirts of the capital will cut the railway lines. We won’t let any trains in or out. With control of the country’s nerve centre and all communications cut, and the leaders shot, power is in our hands. All this may sound crazy, but it’s possible. When you’re about to carry out something like this, you’re always in a dream-like state, as if you were sleepwalking. Yet you go towards your goal with a kind of slow-motion speed that makes it all seem so surprising once you’ve got there. All you need is the willpower and money … Apart from our revolutionary cells, we can organise a gang of murderers and thieves. I wonder how many planes the army has? But once the communications are cut, the barracks taken over, and all the leaders shot, who is going to call them out? This is a country of dumb animals. We have to have firing squads. That’s indispensable. We’ll only win respect if we spread terror. Men are nothing but cowards. With a machine gun … How will they organise the forces meant to fight us? With the telegraph and the telephones out, and the railway lines cut … ten men can keep a town of 10,000 people in fear. All they need is a machine gun. Eleven million people in Argentina. The tea plantations of the north would be with us. The sugar-cane areas of Tucuman and Santiago del Estero … San Juan, they’re already half-communist there … the only opposition would be the army. We could take the barracks at night. Once we’ve seized their weapons, shot the officers and strung up all the sergeants, we’d only need ten men to hold a barracks of a thousand soldiers &mdash; provided we have a machine gun. It’s so easy. And what about the hand grenades, where do they come into it? If we can take them by surprise at the same time through the entire country, with ten men per town Argentina is ours. The soldiers are young and would follow us anyway. We’ll make officers of the non-commissioned and create the most unlikely army in the history of America. Why not? What are the raids on the San Martin bank, or the hospital in Rawson, or the Martelli agency in Montevideo, compared to this? With three determined newspaper vendors we can take a city.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An ill-defined anger makes the blood pound in his veins. The blood rushes through his sturdy body, all geared up as if for an attack. He feels stronger than ever, the strength of someone with the power to shoot others.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Each crash from the storm sent the electric light swinging, but the Astrologer went on sitting on the trunk with his back to the bed, legs crossed, chin in hand, staring fixedly at the five puppets, whose ragged shadows leapt and danced on the pink wall.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Behind him, the puddle from the rain seeping in at the window grew, and still the silent questions and answers flew through the air. Sometimes a frown darkened the Astrologer’s face, then a slow blink of his unmoving eyes in the broad face showed he had found a reply that satisfied him. He sat there until dawn, then stood up and turned his back on the five puppets, who were left in the solitude of the room, swinging on their gibbet like five hanged men.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer hesitated for a moment, then rushed down the stairs, out of the front door, and strode over in the first light to the coachhouse where Barsut was being held.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The rain had stopped. The clouds had broken up, leaving the sight of a yellow slice of moon in a clear blue sky.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-80" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-37" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897199393824" class="calibre10"></a>
     THE REVELATION <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">While all this was happening, in Las Mercedes asylum Ergueta was experiencing what he was later to call his “meeting with God”. This is how it happened.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He woke at dawn in the ward. An oblong of moonlight painted a blue rectangle on the whitewashed wall opposite his bed. The sky stood out framed by the wooden bars of the open window, a powdery dry blue like plaster dipped in methylene. Between the bars twinkled the watery beams of a distant star.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta scratched his nose energetically. He was not particularly worried. He understood that he was in a madhouse, but it “was something that didn’t concern him”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was worried they might have imprisoned his spirit, but what was actually locked up in the asylum was his body, his body weighing ninety kilos, which he now remembered with a surge of shame he had dragged through so many brothels. Unable to stop himself, he saw again the circus parade his dissolute life had been. What did his spirit have to do with all the fury of his flesh?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He saw this as so obvious he was amazed that the doctors had still not realised it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta was delighted at his discovery. He was no longer a man, but a spirit, “a pure sensation of the soul”, its outlines clearly defined within the framework of his flesh, like clouds in the infinite blue.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He felt happy and light. On previous nights he had become convinced he could leave his body, casting it off as casually as a suit of clothes. This sudden conviction made him slightly afraid. At certain moments he even had the sensation that he was only in contact with the tips of his soul, so that the balance between his body, about to fall behind, and the surface of his skin left him nauseous, as if he were travelling down in a speeding lift.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was also afraid of completely leaving his body behind. If it was destroyed, how would he ever get back into it? The nurse looked a vicious sort, and although Ergueta would have liked to be sure he would not do away with his body before he came back, he could not trust him. But once he had got over this first impression, Ergueta saw him more as a weak child, although this did not stop the nurse laughing at the sight of him trying to control his ninety kilos, unaware of the fact that Ergueta could go wherever he liked … but no … he did not want to play games. His goodness would not allow that. And how beautiful it was to feel himself so full of charity! His compassion spread over the world like a cloud over the roofs of the city.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His body lay further and further below.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Now he could see it as if it were at the bottom of a box: the asylum was just one white cube among a whole row of them; the streets glinted blue among banks of shadow; the green lights of the railway shone feebly; then space entered him like the ocean into a sponge, and time ceased to exist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The heights fell beneath him in his soaring joy: Ergueta was at peace with himself, a wellspring of goodness willed by some outside force. He rejoiced like a dry lake must rejoice when heaven sends it rain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he turned to look on the earth with his charity, he saw its green rounded edges with their filmy coating of the blue ether. And since the sight left him speechless, all he found to say was: “Thank you … thank you Lord.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He felt no stirring of curiosity. A sense of submission reinforced his humility.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the celestial fields he suddenly caught sight of a rocky hill. Although it was night, the rocks were bathed in a golden glow, and the blue in the distance fell from the golden heights into deep ravines. His body restored to him, Ergueta walked cautiously forward, his fierce eyes unwavering in his hawk-like features.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Of course he could feel anxious, because his body had fallen into sin on countless occasions, and because he knew that in spite of its present solemn expression, his face bore the violent features of a thug, just like the ones he had imitated as a child in the gangs of his poor neighbourhood.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Yet his spirit was seeking forgiveness, and that might be enough, though he could not help but exclaim: “What will the Lord say of my ‘mug’? How dare I show myself before him?” When he looked down at his shoes and saw how they needed a polish, he was even more afraid.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What will the Lord say of the way I look; when he sees what a gambler and a pimp I am? He’ll ask about my sins … he’ll remember all the stunts I’ve pulled … and how will I answer him? … that I didn’t know … but how can I say that, when he left proof of his existence with all the prophets?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He gazed down at his dirty, scuffed shoes once more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He’ll say to me: ‘You’ve even turned into a bum … a filthy tramp: you who went to university … you gambled on horses, you besmirched the immortal soul I gave you in orgies, you dragged your guardian angel into brothel after brothel while he wept after you, as you filled your slobbering mouth with abominations …’ And the worst of it is I won’t be able to deny a thing … how can I deny my sin? What a mess, dear Lord!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Above his head the sky was a blue plaster dome. Distant planets revolved on their axes like oranges, and Ergueta looked humbly up towards the golden rocks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">All at once he became greatly troubled. Lifting his head he saw &mdash; not ten paces to his left &mdash; the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Wrapped in a sky-blue robe, the Nazarene turned his gaunt profile towards him. One calm, almond-shaped eye shone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta was thrown into great confusion &mdash; he could not kneel because “a gent never bends his back” and would never kneel before a Jewish carpenter, and yet he felt a tremendous sob wrenching his soul, and silently stretched out his arms, hands clasped in entreaty, towards the silent God.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He felt all his ignoble frame being filled with devotion to him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta stared in silence at Jesus perched on the rocks. His eyes brimmed with tears. He lamented that there was no-one else there to come to blows with, just to demonstrate his great love to the Lord, and finally the silence grew so unbearable he overcame his terrible bewilderment and humbly said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’d like to be different, but I can’t.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Jesus gazed at him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Believe me … I find it so hard to tell you I love you.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta turned his back, walked three steps away, then turned round and came to a halt again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’ve committed every sin and a lot of cra … nonsense … I’d like to repent, but I can’t … I’d like to be able to kneel … to kiss your feet, you who died on the cross for us … Oh, if you only knew all the things I wanted to tell you, but they’ve slipped my mind … and yet, I do love you. Can I say it because it’s just the two of us here?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Jesus gazed at him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A fresh smile graced Jesus’ face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta was silent for a moment, then blushed and said shyly:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Oh, how good you are! How good! You deign to smile on me, a miserable sinner … D’you see? You smiled. Next to you, believe me, I feel like a child, a mere kid. I’d like to worship you my whole life, to be your bodyguard. From now on I will never sin again, I’ll think of you my whole life, and woe be it on anyone who doubts you … I’ll smash his face in …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Jesus gazed at him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then Ergueta, who wanted to give the best he had to offer, said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I kneel before you” &mdash; he took a few steps forward and when he came level with Jesus bent his head, put one knee on the golden rocks &mdash; but just as he was about to prostrate himself, Jesus reached out his pierced hand, touched him on the shoulder, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Come. Follow me always and sin no more, because your soul is as beautiful as those of the angels who praise the Lord.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta wanted to say something, but found himself surrounded by a silent, rushing emptiness. Ergueta understood he had met God. This was obvious, because when he turned to listen to the voices calling out in the dark ward, a madman who had been dumb since birth shouted out in astonishment:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You look as if you’ve just come down from heaven.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Ergueta was amazed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You have a halo of light round your head like the saints.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Fear took hold of Ergueta. He leant his head back against the wall. A one-eyed inmate who had been quiet until now suddenly exclaimed: “Miracles … you can perform miracles. You gave the dumb man his speech back.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Their conversation woke a third lunatic, who spent the whole day squashing lice between his worn, calloused fingers. Turning his bearded face to Ergueta, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You came to resurrect the dead …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And to restore sight to the blind,” the dumb man added.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“And to the half-blind,” the lunatic with one eye missing insisted. “I can see with this eye now.” The deaf-mute pushed himself upright in his bed, and went on:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But it’s not you doing this, it’s God, who is in your body.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Bewildered, Ergueta replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s true, brothers … it’s not me … but God who is inside me … how could I, a wretched whoremonger, perform miracles?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At this the louse-hunter, who was sitting on the edge of his bed, swinging his naked feet, suggested:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why don’t you do another miracle?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s not why I’m here, but to preach the word of the living God.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The louse-hunter swung one foot up over his knee and said nastily:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You should do a miracle.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The deaf-mute put his pillow on the floor, sat on it and declared: “I’m not saying another word.” Stunned by all he saw, Ergueta took his head in his hands. The one-eyed man added amiably:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, you should bring the dead man back to life.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“There’s no dead man here!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The one-eyed man limped over to Ergueta. He took him by the arm and almost dragged him over to a bed opposite, where a tiny man with a round head and an enormous nose lay without moving.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The deaf-mute came over, pursing his lips.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Can’t you see that he’s dead?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He died this afternoon,” the one-eyed man added.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I tell you this man is not dead,” Ergueta shouted angrily, convinced they were making fun of him. But the louse-hunter leapt from his bed and, going over to the other one, bent over the little man with the round head. He pushed the body until it fell to the ward floor with a dull thud, stuck between the two beds with its legs in the air, like the fork of a newly pollarded tree.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Now can you see he’s dead?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Their nightshirts billowing in the wind, the four madmen stood around the upturned body, silhouetted against the blue rectangle of moonlight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“See that he’s dead?” the bearded man repeated.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Do a miracle for us,” the one-eyed man begged Ergueta. “How can we believe in Him if you don’t perform a miracle? What’s it to you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The deaf-mute nodded his head rapidly, egging Ergueta on. Ergueta leant sombrely over the body, and was about to pronounce the life-giving words when suddenly the walls of the room started to spin before his eyes, a dark wind howled in his ears, and he just had time to catch sight again of the three madmen silhouetted in the blue rectangle of moonlight, their nightshirts ballooning out in the wind, before he fell down a slope through the whirling darkness, into unconsciousness.</div>

     THE SUICIDE <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">For almost an hour Erdosain remained at Hipólita’s feet. His earlier emotions were blurred in his present somnolent state. He felt remote from all that had happened during the day. Anguish and resentment hardened in his heart like mud in the sun. Yet he lay there without moving, overcome by the desire for sleep that weariness instilled in him. And he was frowning deeply. His other great fear, the fear of finding himself standing like a lost ghost beside a granite dike, pierced the mist and darkness. The grey waters formed layers that swirled in different directions. Iron-clad whaling boats took indistinct masses of people to distant shores. There was a woman decked out like a coquette: she wore a diamond choker, and sat with her head in her bejewelled hands at a bar-room table. While she was talking, Erdosain scratched the tip of his nose. When he searched for the reason for this, Erdosain remembered that four young girls had appeared, wearing knee-length dresses, and with straw-coloured hair dishevelled round their horsy faces. As they passed by him, they held out a tin cup, which made Erdosain wonder: “Can they earn enough to eat by begging like that?” Then the star, the coquette, with the diamonds sparkling beneath her chin, replied that yes, the four girls lived from begging, and in her most alluring voice embarked on a story about a Russian prince whose way of life did not at all fit in with that of the four girls, try as she might to fix things. It was only then that Erdosain realised why he had heen scratching his nose while the gorgeous creature had been talking.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His sadness increased when he saw the silent crowds of people look back as they climbed aboard an endless train, which had all its shutters down. No-one asked about destinations or stations on the way. Twenty yards from the track stretched a dark desert of dust. Erdosain could not see the locomotive, but heard the screech of chains as the brakes were let off. He could run, the train was moving off slowly, he could reach it, climb the steps and stand for a moment on the platform of the last carriage, watching as it picked up speed. There was still time for him to get away from this grey solitude, devoid even of dark cities … but, held in the claws of his immense despair, he stood watching, a sob in his throat, as the last carriage pulled away, all its windows firmly shut.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he saw the train round the curve and head into the wall of fog, he realised he had been left on his own for ever in this ashen desert, that it would never return but keep rolling sullenly on and on, its carriage windows shut tight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He slowly lifted his head from Hipólita’s lap. It had stopped raining. His legs were freezing, and his joints ached. He looked at the face of the sleeping woman, barely visible in the faint blue light of day seeping in through the door-panes, and stood up as carefully as he could. The four little girls with their horse faces and straw-coloured locks were still with him. He thought: “I should kill myself …” but then, noting the red glint of the sleeping woman’s hair, his ideas took on a more sinister bent. “She must be ruthless. And yet I could kill her …” He felt for the revolver butt in his pocket. “It would only take one bullet in the head. The bullet’s made of steel, it would only make a tiny hole. Of course, her eyes would be blown out of their sockets and her nose would probably pour blood. Poor soul! She must have suffered so much. But I’m sure she’s cruel.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A stealthy malice made him lean over her. The longer he looked at her asleep, the wilder, more crazed his expression became. In his pocket, his hand cocked the gun. Then a peal of thunder burst in the distance, and the strange madness shrouding his brain was lifted. Erdosain felt for his coat as quietly as possible, shut both sides of the door with great care to avoid them creaking, and stepped out of the room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he realised with satisfaction that he was hungry. He headed at a shambling run for one of the countless grills around the Spinetto market.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The moon was riding the purple crest of a cloud, and in the moonlight whole stretches of the pavement looked as if they were covered in zinc sheeting; the puddles glinted as though silver coins were hidden in their depths, the rainwater gurgled and swirled in the gutters, licking at the granite kerbs. The pavement was so wet it looked as though all the blocks were recently smelted lead.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain dodged in and out of the blue shadows that fell between the rows of buildings. The smell of damp lent a kind of maritime desolation to the morning solitude.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There was no doubt about it, Erdosain was not in his right mind. He was still worried about the four horse-faced young girls and the sinister sea with its iron waves. The stench of burnt cooking oil belching from a yellow-painted café door made him feel nauseous and so, changing his mind, he decided to aim for a brothel he remembered in Paso. When he got there, he found the door already locked, so, at a loss, shivering with cold, his mouth full of a bitter taste of copper sulphate, he went into a nearby café that had just raised its metal shutters. After a long wait, they served him the tea he had ordered.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He thought about the sleeping woman. He half-closed his eyes, leant his head back against the wall, and surrendered utterly to his despair.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He did not suffer for himself, for the person registered on his birth certificate, but his consciousness, split off from his body, looked at him like a stranger, and he said to himself:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Who will have pity on mankind?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And these words, which summed up all his thinking, upset him even more, filling him with a painful tenderness towards his invisible fellow men.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Falling … falling lower all the time. And yet others are happy, they find love &mdash; but they all suffer. The thing is, some realise it and others don’t. Some blame it on what they haven’t got. What a ridiculous dream that was! Yet her face was lovely. What made the most sense was what she said about the unscrupulous prince. Oh! If only I could sleep at the bottom of the sea, in a lead chamber with thick portholes. Sleep for years and years, while the sand piled up, and I went on sleeping. That’s why the Astrologer is right. The day will come when people will make the revolution because they have no God. Mankind will declare itself on strike until God appears.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The bitter smell of cyanide drifted into his nostrils; through his half-closed eyelids he could dimly make out the milky light of morning, but he felt as distant as if he had been on the sea-bed and the sand was piling up endlessly on top of his leaden hut. Somebody tapped him on the shoulder.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He opened his eyes to find the waiter saying to him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You can’t sleep here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was about to reply, but the waiter had moved on to wake up another customer. This was a stocky man who had fallen asleep with his bald head in his arms, which were folded across the table-top.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The sleeping man did not respond to the waiter’s urgings, so the café owner, a man with a handlebar moustache, came over and shook him so violently his body almost doubled up, and only the edge of the table kept it from toppling over.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Intrigued, Erdosain got to his feet, while the other two cast sidelong glances at each other and at their odd client.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The sleeping man did not move from his absurd position. His head lolled back on one shoulder, giving them a glimpse of a flat, pockmarked face and a pair of dark glasses. A trickle of reddish saliva ran down from his blue-tinged lips to his green tie. A sheet of paper with writing on was trapped under his elbow on the table. They suddenly realised he was dead. They went off to call the police, but Erdosain remained rooted to the spot, fascinated at the sight of this sinister suicide in dark glasses, with blue blotches slowly spreading over the skin. And still the smell of bitter almonds hung in the air, apparently coming from his gaping mouth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A part-time policeman arrived, then a sergeant, followed by two more policemen and an inspector. They all poked and prodded at the dead man as if he were a steer. All at once the part-time policeman said to the inspector:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t you know who he is?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">From the dead man’s pocket the sergeant took a hotel bill, a few coins, a revolver, and three sealed envelopes. “So this is the man who killed that girl over in Talcahuano?” They took the dead man’s glasses off, and now his eyes were visible, squinting, with their whites turned up, and the eyelids shot through with red as if he had been crying tears of blood. “Didn’t I tell you?” the first policeman said. “Here’s his identity card.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He was going to go to Ushuaia for the rest of his life.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he heard that, Erdosain remembered the story as if he had read about it in the distant past. (In fact, he had seen it in a newspaper only the morning before.) The dead man was a crook. He had left his wife and five children to live with another woman, whom he had three children with. But then two nights earlier he had appeared at a hotel in Talcahuano with his new lover, a young girl aged seventeen. And at three in the morning he had covered her face gently in a pillow, and shot her through the side of the head. Nobody in the hotel heard a thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At eight the next morning the murderer got dressed, left the door to the room ajar, and called the maid to ask her not to wake his wife until ten o’clock because she was very tired. Then he went out, and the dead girl was finally discovered at noon.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But what most impressed Erdosain was the thought that the murderer had spent five hours alone with the dead girl, five hours with her body in the loneliness of the night … and that he must have loved her a lot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And yet hadn’t he felt exactly the same a few hours earlier with the red-headed woman? Was it an unconscious memory, or did it come from the suicide doubled up in front of him?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The hospital ambulance drew up and the body was loaded into it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The police asked him questions. Erdosain told them the little he knew, then went out into the street, still intrigued. An ill-defined, painful question lay at the back of his mind.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He recalled that the turn-ups of the dead man’s trousers were muddy; his shirt was dirty and grimy: how in spite of all this had he succeeded in winning the love of the young girl he had killed?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Did love exist then? In spite of his two wives and scattered children, in spite of his sordid life as a thief and a swindler, the murderer had known love. Erdosain pictured him in the cruel night, there in that hotel frequented by prostitutes and people with no real jobs, in a room with peeling wallpaper, staring at the waxen, cold face of the young girl spattered with blood. Five mournful hours staring at the girl who a short while before had taken him in her bare arms. Erdosain reached the Plaza Once in this painful daze.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was five in the morning. He went into the railway station, looked all around him, and, still feeling sleepy, went and huddled on a bench in a corner of the waiting-room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">At eight he was woken out of a deep sleep by the noise a passenger made with his suitcases. He rubbed his aching eyes. The sun was shining in a cloudless sky.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He went outside and caught a bus to Constitución Station.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer was waiting for him on the platform at Temperley.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain immediately recognised his stocky figure in its overcoat, his hat down over his eyes and his drooping Gallic moustache.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re very pale,” the Astrologer said.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I’m pale?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yellow.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I didn’t sleep well … and to top it all, I saw a suicide this morning …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, here’s the cheque.” Erdosain examined it. It was made out for 15,373 pesos, to be paid in cash &mdash; but the date was for two days earlier.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Why did he put that date?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’ll look better. The bank clerk will know that if the cheque had been lost, by the time you present it, it would have been stopped.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did he argue a lot?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … he smiled. He thinks he’s going to send us all to gaol … ah! and before you go to the bank, visit a barber’s and get a shave.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Does Bromberg know?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, we’ll wake him when it’s time.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">There were only a few minutes before the train arrived. Erdosain smiled at the Astrologer and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What would you do if I ran away?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stroked his moustache, and replied:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s as impossible as the idea that the train won’t stop here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But let’s admit the possibility for a moment.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I can’t. If I thought it even for a second, I wouldn’t send you to cash the cheque … Ah! … Who was it that committed suicide this morning?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A murderer. Very odd. He killed a girl who refused to go and live with him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A waste of effort.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Would you be capable of killing yourself?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … you must realise I’m destined for greater things.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain asked a strange question:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Tell me, d’you think red-haired women are ruthless?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I wouldn’t say that … it’s more that they’re asexual; that’s why the cool way they look at everything leaves such a harsh impression. The Melancholy Thug told me that in all his years as a pimp he’d dealt with hardly any redheads … Anyway, don’t forget to shave. Go to the bank at eleven, not before. I’ll see you at lunch, right?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, see you then.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain got on to the train, closely followed by the Major, who signalled to the Astrologer in acknowledgement. Erdosain did not see him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Slumped in his seat, Erdosain thought:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What an extraordinary man! How on earth did he know I wouldn’t run out on him? If he’s as right about everything else, he’s bound to succeed.” Then, lulled by the rocking of the train, he dozed off to sleep again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major was sitting behind him. When Erdosain got to the bank, his heart was pounding. The clerk called him, and he went up to the window:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Large or small notes?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Large.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Sign here.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain signed the back of the cheque. He thought they would ask for his identity card, but the clerk, forearms protected by plastic cuffs, merely counted out ten 1,000 peso notes, five of 500, and the rest in smaller notes. Erdosain was so nervous he wanted to run away as fast as he could, but instead he slowly counted out the money, put it in his wallet, put that in his trouser pocket, and walked out of the bank, keeping a tight grip on it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A spiral of sky glowed like newly forged metal in between banks of white cloud. Erdosain felt happy. He thought that in a different climate, under permanently blue skies like the one he could glimpse above, there must be remarkable women. They would have shining glossy hair, and big almond eyes, shaded by long lashes. And the scented air would waft from the caverns of morning to all the street corners in cities that rose through grassy lawns, their spherical towers rising high above all the waving plumes of greenery in the parks and terraces.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The thought of the Astrologer’s broad face, with his drooping moustache covering the corners of his mouth, made him feel even more content: if the society succeeded, he could go on with his electro-magnetic experiments. He strode down the streets like an emperor down on his luck, not noticing that his easy swagger caught the eye of washerwomen passing by with baskets under their arms, and of seamstresses returning from the sweatshops with their bundles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He would invent the death ray, a sinister violet beam with millions of volts’ power, which would melt the steel of dreadnoughts like a furnace melts a blob of wax, and would blow the cement cities to smithereens, as if volcanoes of dynamite had exploded under them. He saw himself as the Lord of the Universe. He summoned the ambassadors of the great powers with a terse command. He found himself in a huge glass-walled room with a round table in the middle. All around it, the old diplomats sat slumped in their armchairs, bald, ashen-faced, with hard, shifty eyes. Some tapped their pencils on the glass table-top, others smoked in silence, while a gigantic negro in green livery stood motionless beside the red velvet curtains draped over the doorway.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And he! Erdosain, Augusto Remo Erdosain, the ex-thief, the ex-debt collector, stood up. The glass table reflected the top half of his body, elegant in a double-breasted black blazer, with four fingers of his right hand thrust into his pocket, a sheaf of papers in the other. He stood and stared coldly at the ambassadors’ expressionless faces. A delicious frisson drained the blood from his face. The great heroes of the past came to life in him. Ulysses, Demetrius, Hannibal, Loyola, Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini flashed in front of his eyes like huge burning wheels, then sank beneath the lonely earth in an other-worldly twilight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">His words poured out in short chunks, as hard and solid as steel. Captivated by the spectacle, he observed himself in an imaginary mirror, vibrant and proud.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He was imposing conditions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The nations had to hand over their fleets, thousands of cannons and great stocks of rifles. Then a few hundred members of each race would be selected, taken to an island, and the rest of humanity destroyed. He would use the ray to blow up cities, sweep clean the fields, turn livestock and forests to ashes. All memory of knowledge, art and beauty would be lost for ever. An aristocracy of cynics, bandits as sceptical as they were civilised, would seize power, with him at their head. And since to be happy all men need to base their hope on a metaphysical lie, they would strengthen the clergy, and set up an inquisition to root out any heresy that might threaten the foundations of the dogma or unity of faith that would be the basis for human happiness. In this way, mankind could return to primitive society, and as in the time of the pharaohs devote itself to agriculture. This metaphysical lie would give mankind back the happiness that rational thought had killed off in its heart. His words fell with short sharp thuds, like steel rods. He told the ambassadors:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Our city, the city of kings, will be of white marble, set beside the sea. It will measure seven leagues round, and will have lakes and woods, and rosy copper domes. This will be the dwelling-place of all the fake holy men, the false prophets, the quack magicians, the apocryphal goddesses. All science will be magic. Doctors will travel round disguised as angels, and when mankind multiplies too much, it will be punished by glowing dragons flying through the air to drop the bacteria of Asiatic cholera.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Mankind will live immersed in miracles, and will be rich above all in faith. At night we’ll use powerful searchlights to project ‘The entry of the just into heaven’ on to the clouds. Can you imagine it? All of a sudden, a green and purple ray rises from behind the mountains, and the clouds become a garden where the dazzling air floats like snowflakes. An angel with rose-coloured wings will cross the divide, come to a halt at the gates of paradise, and with open arms will welcome in the just man, a man of the people, with his battered hat, long beard, and stick. Can you see it, you professional scoundrels, you eminent cynics? Can you? The angel with rose-coloured wings welcomes the man who on earth sweats and suffers. D’you realise how brilliant my idea is, how wonderful my simple miracle? And the masses will worship God on their knees, and only we, the sad bandits who have power, knowledge and the ultimate truth, will know that heaven does not exist.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He shook as he spoke.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’ll be like gods. We’ll offer mankind tremendous miracles, delicious beauties, we’ll present them with the certainty of such a glorious future that all the priests’ promises will pale beside the reality of our apocryphal wonders. And finally, they’ll be happy … Can you see it, you cretins?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">A careless passer-by bumped into him and sent him flying against a wall. Erdosain got his breath back fearfully, clutching the money in his pocket. He was excited, like a tiger cub let loose in a brick jungle, and spat his defiance at the window of a fashion boutique:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You will be ours, city.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Major followed close behind him.</div>
   
   
    <h2 id="calibre_link-82" class="calibre14"><a id="calibre_link-39" class="calibre10"></a><a name="TOC_idm139897199287424" class="calibre10"></a>
     THE WINK <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer was waiting for him at Temperley Station. He smiled warmly at Erdosain, who almost ran to meet him, but the other man took hold of his arms and stood looking into his eyes for a moment. Then he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, are you satisfied?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain blushed. At that instant a double mystery was revealed to him. First, the Astrologer had not been lying, and second, he felt so close to him he could have talked endlessly with him, telling him all the most intimate details of his desolate life. All he managed to say was:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, I’m very happy.” The Astrologer came to a halt for a moment on the platform. Suddenly serious again, he said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you know something? Many of us have a superman inside. The superman is our will when it is fully realised, when it overcomes all moral scruples and carries out the most dreadful acts, with an almost naive joy … what you might call the innocent game of cruelty.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes, and you no longer feel fear or anguish, it’s as if you’re walking on clouds.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Right, and the ideal would be to arouse this carefree, naive ferocity in as many men as possible. It’s our job to usher in the age of the Innocent Monster. It will happen, there’s no doubt about it. It’s simply a matter of time and being bold enough, but when men realise that their spirit is being swept down into the cesspit of this civilisation, they must change direction before they drown. The problem is, cowardice and Christianity have prevented them from realising just how sick they are.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But didn’t you want to bring everyone faith?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, only the masses … but if that fails, we can always try the opposite tack. We haven’t finally chosen any one principle, and the wisest thing would be to have opposing ones ready just in case. Just like in a pharmacy, we’ll have a wide variety of perfect lies, each one labelled for a different disease of the mind or soul.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“D’you know I reckon you’re the craziest of all of us, as Barsut said yesterday?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What’s known as madness is simply what most people aren’t accustomed to thinking. Look, if that porter over there told you all the ideas in his mind, you’d lock him up in an asylum. Of course, there can’t be many like us … the essential thing is that our actions will bring us fresh strength and energy. That’s where our salvation lies.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What about Barsut?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“He hasn’t the faintest idea of what’s in store for him.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How will you do it?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Bromberg will strangle him … I don’t know, it doesn’t concern me.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The two of them stepped round the puddles in the bright sunlight. Erdosain said to himself: “Our city, the city of kings, will be of white marble, set beside the sea … and we’ll be like gods” &mdash; at that he turned to his companion, eyes gleaming, and exclaimed &mdash; “d’you know that some day we’ll be like gods?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what the common herd doesn’t understand. They’ve had their gods slaughtered. But the day will come when they run down the paths shouting: ‘We love God, we need God.’ What imbeciles! I can’t understand how they have killed God. But we’ll bring him back to life … we’ll invent grandiose gods &mdash; the epitome of civilisation … and life will be changed for ever!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What if it all fails?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It doesn’t matter … someone else will come … someone else will come to take my place. That’s what must happen. All we should wish for is that the idea sprouts in people’s imaginations … the day it exists in many souls, wonderful things will happen.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain was amazed at how calm he felt.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He had lost all fear, and the room with the ambassadors came into his mind once more, his baleful gaze on the ancient diplomats gazing at him in consternation, their bald heads, ashen faces, hard, furtive eyes. Unable to contain himself, he shouted out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“What a lot of fuss over wringing one blasted man’s neck!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer stared at him in surprise:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Are you nervous, or do you get worked up for no particular reason, like an elephant?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, it’s just that I’m so sick of these old-fashioned scruples I feel.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“That’s what all you kids are like,” the Astrologer replied. “Like a cat not knowing whether to come in or go out.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Shall I watch the execution?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Does it interest you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“A lot.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But as they entered the Astrologer’s property, a sick feeling churned Erdosain’s stomach, and the gastric taste of vomit rose in his throat. He could hardly stand up. He saw everything through a milky white haze. His arms hung down as heavy as bronze. He walked without any sense of distance; it seemed to him as though the air was turning to glass, as though the ground was heaving beneath his feet, and every now and then the vertical line of the trees seemed to zig-zag in front of his eyes. He panted wearily, his mouth was completely dry, and he could not moisten his parched lips or his burning throat. Only a sense of shame kept him on his feet.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">When he next looked through half-closed eyes, he was going into the coachhouse with Bromberg.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Man Who Saw the Midwife was walking along as if in a daze, his thick hair completely unkempt. His trousers were only loosely held up by his belt, and a bit of white shirt stuck out of the front of his flies like a handkerchief. He was trying to stifle enormous yawns with his fist. His sleepy, absentminded look did not fit in with his criminal intentions. He had fine eyes, blank and solemn as those of some great dumb beast, which gazed out from thick lashes that cast shadows on his rounded, girlish cheeks. Erdosain stared at him, but the other man did not even appear to notice him, so caught up was he in his own magnificent absurdity. Then with the same blank look he gazed across at the Astrologer, who nodded to him, and he undid the padlock. The three men stepped into the stable.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Barsut leapt to his feet: he wanted to talk. Bromberg sprang through the air, and there was the sound of a crack of skulls against wood. The sun painted a yellow rectangle in the dust. Muffled groans came from the shapeless heap on the floor. Erdosain watched the struggle with a cruel fascination, and suddenly, as Bromberg was throttling the other man with his powerful arms, his trousers slipped down, revealing two white buttocks under a crumpled shirt-tail. The groans had stopped. There was a moment’s quiet as the half-naked murderer continued to press his hands round the victim’s throat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stood there looking on immobile.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer looked on with watch in hand. They all stayed motionless for two minutes, which to Erdosain seemed like an eternity.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK, that’s enough.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Clumsily, his hair matted on his brow, Bromberg stood up. Without looking at anyone with his blank gaze, he hitched his trousers up, and fastened them as quickly as he could.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then he left the stables. Erdosain followed him, while the Astrologer cast one last look at the murdered man. Barsut was lying on the floor staring at the ceiling, his jaws slack and his tongue lolling out of his twisted mouth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Then a strange thing happened, without Erdosain being aware of it. Pausing at the stable door, the Astrologer turned back to look at the dead man, when all of a sudden Barsut raised his head and winked<sup class="calibre15">5</sup> at him. The Astrologer touched his hat brim with one finger, then went out to join Erdosain, who burst out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Is that all?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer cast him a pitying glance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did you really think it would be like in the theatre?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“How are you going to get rid of the body?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’ll dissolve it in nitric acid. I’ve got three containers full. But, to change the subject, what happened with the copper rose?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It came out perfectly. The Espilas are really happy. I saw a fine specimen last night.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“OK then, let’s have lunch … we’ve earned it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As they were going into the dining-room, a thought struck the Astrologer: “Aren’t we going to wash our hands?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Taken aback, Erdosain stared at him, then lifted his hands to look at them. The three of them filed out quickly to the bathroom, took off their jackets, and turned on the taps. Erdosain rolled his sleeves up and carefully washed himself with a bar of soap. Then he rinsed his hands and dried them briskly on the towel. Before they went out again, the Astrologer did something odd.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He took the towel and threw it into the bathtub, then took a bottle of alcohol and sprinkled it over the cloth. He struck a match, and for a minute both their faces were lit up in the dark room by the blue flames of the fuel consuming the towel. Eventually all that was left was a blackish pile of ashes: the Astrologer turned the tap on, and the water gushed out, flushing away the remains. The two men headed back to the dining-room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">An ironic smile flitted across Erdosain’s face.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So you’re Pontius Pilate, are you?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You’re right, and quite unconsciously.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Through the half-open shutters of the shady dining-room, they could see the garden. Tender shoots of honeysuckle curled towards the windowsill. Transparent insects buzzed around the lemon tree, and the house’s white walls were reflected in the honeyed depths of the waxed floor. The tablecloth fringe fell down over square table legs. A spray of carnations gave off its spicy scent in an Etruscan vase, while the silver cutlery shone against the linen and the china; shadows twisted up the glassy outlines of their glasses, or crept in triangles across their plates. There was lobster salad in an oval serving dish.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The Astrologer poured wine. They ate in silence. Then the Astrologer brought in egg broth, a platter of asparagus swimming in oil, an artichoke salad, and finally fish. For dessert there was ricotta cheese sprinkled with cinnamon, and fruit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Afterwards he served coffee. Erdosain gave him the money, and the Astrologer counted it. “Here’s 3,500. Go and have a few suits made. You’re a good-looking fellow and you should dress well.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Thanks … but listen … I’m dead tired. I’d like to sleep a while. Could you wake me at five?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Of course, follow me” &mdash; and the Astrologer led him to his bedroom. Completely drained, Erdosain took off his boots, and threw his jacket over the bedpost. His eyes were smarting with fatigue, his chest was running with sweat, and then he thought no more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He awoke in the dark to the sound of the Astrologer opening a shutter. He sat up with a start, while the other man said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“At last! You’ve been asleep for twenty-eight hours.” And when Erdosain could not believe it, he brought him that day’s newspapers, and it was true, two days had gone by since he had last seen them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Suddenly remembering Hipólita, Erdosain leapt from the bed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“I have to go.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You were out like a dead man. I’ve never seen anyone sleep like that, so exhausted, you even forgot to go to the bathroom … oh, by the way, where did you get that story about the suicide in the café? I looked in yesterday evening’s papers and in this morning’s. There’s no sign of it. You must have dreamt it.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“But I could take you to the café.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“You must have dreamt the café as well.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Perhaps … it doesn’t matter … well?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Everything’s taken care of.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Everything? What about the acid?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“We’ll tip it down the drain.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So then he …?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“It’s as if he never existed.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">As they were saying goodbye, the Astrologer told him:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Come on Wednesday at five. There’s a meeting that evening. Don’t forget to buy a suit off the peg while they’re making the other ones for you. You must come; the Gold Prospector, the Thug and others will be here. We’ll talk over our ideas, and don’t forget I’m really interested in that poison gas scheme. Draw up a plan for a small-scale factory for chlorine and phosgene gases. Ah, and see if you can find out what on earth mustard gas is. It destroys anything that’s not watertight and covered in oil.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Phosgene is based on carbon monoxide.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Don’t lose any time, Erdosain. A small factory that could be a training tool for revolutionary chemists. Remember our activities are divided into three areas. The Gold Prospector will be in charge of the training camp, you’re our Industrial Chief, and Haffner will look after the brothels. Now we’ve got the money, we mustn’t lose time. You have to set to work. What d’you say we set up a story that is the Argentine equivalent of Krupp in Germany. We have to believe in ourselves. Our society can spring a whole lot of surprises. We’re discoverers who have only a vague idea of which direction we’re heading in.<sup class="calibre15">6</sup> If that!”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Erdosain stared for a second at the other man’s broad face. He grinned and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Did you know you look like Lenin?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And before the Astrologer could reply, he was gone.</div>

     ARLT’S LIFE AND TIMES <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">Roberto Godofredo Christophersen Arlt was born in Buenos Aires on 26 April 1900. The family name came from his father, who was born in Poznan, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. The first names came from his mother, who apparently chose Godofredo after reading Torcuato Tasso’s <em class="calibre11">Jerusalem Freed</em>. The couple were among hundreds of thousands of European immigrants who arrived in turn-of-the-century Argentina. Arlt’s father worked at a variety of trades without ever achieving much success; his mother had three children, but saw two of them die in the slum conditions of a chaotically expanding city.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Roberto’s father seems to have inspired fear and hatred in him: the “work of humiliation” that Erdosain describes in <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em> is apparently a painful memory of his own childhood. So unhappy was Roberto that he left home at the age of sixteen. He lived the rest of his teens in the smaller inland city of Cordoba, only to re-appear four years later in the capital, married and with a young daughter.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the years at the start of this century, Argentina was at its most optimistic and economically powerful. Earnings from meat and grain exports placed it among the top ten wealthiest nations in the world. The Buenos Aires Arlt knew was rapidly being transformed from a small port in the far south of a still unknown continent, into a cosmopolitan city. Since the 1870s, Argentine governments had encouraged European immigration: from Spain, but also from Italy, from the Austro-Hungarian empire (among them the “Polish shoemakers” fascinated by spiritualism described in the novel), German and French people (including the much sought-after prostitutes also mentioned in <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>) as well as a large influx of Jews chased from Russia by the pogroms. There was also a large “English” community, although like Arlt’s second wife they were usually Irish or Scottish. They ran the gas companies, the banks, the trams and the railways and set up enclaves in the suburbs of Buenos Aires like the railway junction Temperley where much of the action of <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em> takes place.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Many of these European immigrants came from an agricultural, village or small town background. They were attracted to Argentina by the promise of land to farm: the vast spaces of the pampas and Patagonia which had only recently been opened up by the crushing of the indigenous Indian groups. But this land was firmly in the hands of a few owners, so that nearly all the new arrivals found themselves forced back into the port city of Buenos Aires, perched on the very edge of the Atlantic seaboard. There they were crowded into the rented tenement houses or <em class="calibre11">conventillos</em> that Arlt grew up in, which also loom large in <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>. Prostitution, violence and street crimes were rife in this unstable mixture of backgrounds and languages, as the newcomers struggled to establish themselves not only in a new hemisphere but in a hostile urban environment. Yet this mix of foreign immigrants also brought invaluable new elements to Argentine society: books (including Dostoevski, whose <em class="calibre11">Brothers Karamazov</em> and <em class="calibre11">The Possessed</em> are clear inspirations for this book), new ideas, religious and political movements that included everything from Spanish anarchism to Soviet socialism. This mixture gave rise to a vivid cultural life reflected in the creation of that quintessential Buenos Aires music the tango, in newspapers, literary movements, and a thriving publishing industry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It was this emerging society that Roberto Arlt soon began to portray. After his return to Buenos Aires in 1920, he began work as a journalist, first on the crime pages of a newspaper, then with his own column of <em class="calibre11">Aguafuertes porteñas</em> (<em class="calibre11">Buenos Aires Sketches</em>). A first novel <em class="calibre11">El juguete rabioso</em> (<em class="calibre11">The Enraged Toy</em>) was published in 1926, but largely passed unnoticed. <em class="calibre11">Los siete locos</em> (<em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>), which ArIt considered his most important work, was published in October 1929, once again to little critical attention.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Arlt’s madmen are holy fools. Their dreams of finding paradise on earth are endlessly thwarted by a society that spurns their need for purity, and offers instead only incomprehension and constant humiliation. This process begins in childhood, as Erdosain confesses to his wife when she is about to leave him. Not only does the father savagely punish the boy, but by deliberately delaying the punishment until “tomorrow”, he succeeds in poisoning the future, leaving the wretched child with only fear and an overwhelming need to escape reality in imagination or in madness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">In the adult Erdosain, as in the other main characters of this novel, or with Silvio Astier in <em class="calibre11">The Enraged Toy</em>, this humiliation spawns both anguish and the rancorous desire “to do something to bring down this society”, governed as it is by “niggardly, stupid lies”. Their imagination is dominated by ways of getting revenge, of paying society back for all it has supposedly inflicted on them. But beyond this bitter desire, Arlt sees little real possibility of ushering in a utopia. The revolution according to the Astrologer will be a mishmash of everything from the racial suprematist visions of the Ku-Klux-Klan to Lenin’s brand of socialism. Even he does not seem to believe in any of the wild ideas put forward by the “apocryphal geniuses” he has attracted to him. Arlt himself certainly does not. By juxtaposition, by irony, by confusion (what finally is the status of this Major who may or may not be an army officer?) he shows his characters as inextricably part of a society which has no fundamental beliefs or sense of direction.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The continuation <em class="calibre11">Los Lanzallamas</em> (<em class="calibre11">The Flamethrowers</em>), which takes up the action immediately where it ends in the current novel, followed in 1931. <em class="calibre11">El amor brujo</em> (<em class="calibre11">Love the Enchanter</em>) appeared in 1932. When this was no more successful than the previous novels, actor friends appear to have persuaded Arlt to try his hand at the theatre. Over the next few years, in addition to continuing with his journalism, Arlt wrote several plays which were successfully performed at the time, but have rarely been revived since. Like Erdosain in <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>, Arlt also considered himself an inventor, and in 1932 is recorded as having taken out a patent on a method to prevent ladders in women’s stockings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">None of these efforts brought Arlt stability or prosperity. His first wife died of tuberculosis, and he was remarried soon after to Elizabeth Mary Shine. He started to travel as a journalist: to Spain, Brazil, and Chile, but died suddenly of a heart attack in Buenos Aires in 1942, before his son Roberto was born.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By then, the Argentina of the early years of the century had changed dramatically. Just a few months after the publication of <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>, the armed forces overthrew the civilian government of Hipólito Yrigoyen. From 1930 until 1983, political life in Argentina alternated between periods when the armed forces attempted to suppress these new forces in Argentine society, and explosive periods when the latter succeeded in pushing themselves to the fore, as under Colonel Juan Domingo Peron.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Arlt’s genius as a writer comes from the way he succeeded in capturing this conflict in Argentine society before it came to erupt. The only true emotion to come out of Arlt’s novels is one of anguish. This anguish eats away at Erdosain, as it does all Arlt’s main characters. In a seething, hostile city, Erdosain wanders the streets, trying in vain to see himself as part of the multifarious life going on behind dark doors. Denied purity, his imagination &mdash; like Hipólita’s, like Barsut’s &mdash; becomes twisted and negative, so that instead of even being creatively destructive and sweeping away all the rottenness perceived around them, in the end it contributes only to their own destruction. The most harrowing pages of <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em> are those where Erdosain struggles desperately to find the physical location of the soul that is causing him so much pain: if we live in a world without transcendence, how can something like the soul exist, and if it does, what shape does it take? Is it thinner and more dangerous than a sword blade? Arlt excels in this depiction of true anguish, felt in the bone, as he does in suggesting real madness when Erdosain is stuck up the acacia tree at dawn, raging like King Lear at the dumb beasts of the field.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Arlt often complained that he did not have the time or the quiet repose necessary to cultivate a proper “style”, and was the first to admit that he wrote “badly”. For many years, when the metaphysical disquisitions of writers like Jorge Luis Borges or Adolfo Bioy Casares were seen as the most perfect expression of Argentine literature he was a neglected figure. Yet there were always those who were concerned with the more sordid challenges that Argentine reality presented them. The Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti pursued the theme of big city alienation in books such as <em class="calibre11">A Brief Life</em> that owe much to Arlt’s example. In the 1960s, Julio Cortazar saw Arlt as a precursor, and returned to the explosive madness of Buenos Aires in his influential novel <em class="calibre11">Rayuela</em> (<em class="calibre11">Hopscotch</em>). Since then, a new generation of Argentine writers has seized on Arlt’s exploration of the still mysterious city of Buenos Aires, his use of its street slang, its crazy juxtapositions, its anguish enlivened by brief moments of exhilaration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Critics have often complained of Arlt’s repetitions, his lack of grammatical accuracy, his wayward logic. The temptation as a translator is to straighten him out, to bring back a decent sense of order and common sense. In translating <em class="calibre11">The Seven Madmen</em>, I have tried not to do this, while at the same time avoiding adding any incoherencies of my own. I only hope that this crazy, disjointed, glorious book still has in English the power of a good sock to the jaw &mdash; as Arlt himself described the power of literature.</div>

     THE VAGARIES OF THE LITERATURE OF DOOM <br class="calibre9" />
    </h2>
    <div class="paragraph">It’s odd that it was bourgeois writers who transported José Hernández’s <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em> to the center of the Argentine canon. The point is debatable, of course, but the truth is that Fierro, the gaucho, paradigm of the dispossessed, of the brave man (but also of the thug), presides over a canon, the Argentine canon, that only keeps getting stranger. As a poem, <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em> is nothing out of this world. As a novel, however, it’s alive, full of meanings to explore, which means that the wind still gusts (or blasts) through it, it still smells of the out-of-doors, it still cheerfully accepts the blows of fate. Nevertheless, it’s a novel of freedom and squalor, not of good breeding and manners. It’s a novel about bravery rather than intelligence, let alone morality.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">If <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em> dominates Argentine literature and its place is in the center of the canon, the work of Borges, probably the greatest writer born in Latin America, is only a footnote.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It’s odd that Borges wrote so much and so well about <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em>. Not just the young Borges, who can be nationalistic at times, if only on the page, but also the adult Borges, who is occasionally thrown into ecstasies (strange ecstasies, as if he were contemplating the gestures of the Sphinx) by the four most memorable scenes in Hernández’s work, and who sometimes even writes perfect, listless stories with plots imitative of Hernández’s. When Borges recalls Hernández, it’s not with the affection and admiration with which he refers to Güiraldes, or with the surprise and resignation evoked by Evaristo Carriego, that familiar bogeyman. With Hernández, or with <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em>, Borges seems to be acting, acting to perfection, in fact, but in a play that strikes him from the beginning as not so much odious as wrongheaded. And yet, odious or wrongheaded, it also seems to him inevitable. In this sense, his silent death in Geneva is highly eloquent. More than eloquent. In fact, his death in Geneva talks a blue streak.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">With Borges alive, Argentine literature becomes what most readers think of as Argentine literature. That is: there’s Macedonio Fernández, who at times resembles the Valéry of Buenos Aires; there’s Güiraldes, who’s rich and ailing; there’s Ezequiel Martínez Estrada; there’s Marechal, who later turns Peronist; there’s Mujica Láinez; there’s Bioy Casares, who writes Latin America’s first and best fantastic novel, though all the writers of Latin America rush to deny it; there’s Bianco; there’s Mallea, the pedant; there’s Silvina Ocampo; there’s Sábato; there’s Cortázar, best of them all; there’s Roberto Arlt, most hard done by. When Borges dies, everything suddenly comes to an end. It’s as if Merlin had died, though Buenos Aires’ literary circles aren’t exactly Camelot. Gone, most of all, is the reign of balance. Apollonian intelligence gives way to Dionysian desperation. Sleep, an often hypocritical, false, accommodating, cowardly sleep, becomes nightmare, a nightmare that’s often honest, loyal, brave, a nightmare that operates without a safety net, but a nightmare in the end, and, what’s worse, a literary nightmare, literary suicide, a literary dead end.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">And yet with the passage of the years it’s fair to ask whether the nightmare, or the skin of the nightmare, is really as radical as its exponents proclaimed. Many of them live much better than I do. In this sense, I can say that I’m an Apollonian rat and they’re starting to look more and more like angora or Siamese cats neatly deflead by a collar labeled Acme or Dionysius, which at this point in history amounts to the same thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Regrettably, Argentine literature today has three reference points. Two are public. The third is secret. All three are in some sense reactions against Borges. All three ultimately represent a step backward and are conservative, not revolutionary, although all three, or at least two of them, have set themselves up as leftist alternatives.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The first is the fiefdom of Osvaldo Soriano, who was a good minor novelist. When it comes to Soriano, you have to have a brain full of fecal matter to see him as someone around whom a literary movement can be built. I don’t mean he’s bad. As I’ve said: he’s good, he’s fun, he’s essentially an author of crime novels or something vaguely like crime novels, whose main virtue &mdash; praised at length by the always perceptive Spanish critical establishment &mdash; is his sparing use of adjectives, a restraint lost, in any case, after his fourth or fifth book. Hardly the basis for a school. Apart from Soriano’s kindness and generosity, which are said to be great, I suspect that his sway is due to sales, to his accessibility, his mass readership, although to speak of a mass readership when we’re really talking about twenty thousand people is clearly an exaggeration. What Argentine writers have learned from Soriano is that they, too, can make money. No need to write original books, like Cortázar or Bioy, or total novels, like Cortázar or Marechal, or perfect stories, like Cortázar or Bioy, and no need, especially, to squander your time and health in a lousy library when you’re never going to win a Nobel Prize anyway. All you have to do is write like Soriano. A little bit of humor, lots of Buenos Aires solidarity and camaraderie, a dash of tango, a worn-out boxer or two, an old but solid Marlowe. But, sobbing, I ask myself on my knees, solid where? Solid in heaven, solid in the toilet of your literary agent? What kind of nobody are you, anyway? You have an agent? And an Argentine agent, no less?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">If the Argentine writer answers this last question in the affirmative, we can be sure that he won’t write like Soriano but like Thomas Mann, like the Thomas Mann of <em class="calibre11">Faust</em>. Or, dizzied by the vastness of the pampa, like Goethe himself.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The second line of descent is more complex. It begins with Roberto Arlt, though it’s likely that Arlt is totally innocent of this mess. Let’s say, to put it modestly, that Arlt is Jesus Christ. Argentina is Israel, of course, and Buenos Aires is Jerusalem. Arlt is born and lives a rather short life, dying at forty-two, if I’m not mistaken. He’s a contemporary of Borges. Borges is born in 1899 and Arlt in 1900. But unlike Borges, Arlt grows up poor, and as an adolescent he goes to work instead of to Geneva. Arlt’s most frequently held job was as a reporter, and it’s in the light of the newspaper trade that one views many of his virtues, as well as his defects. Arlt is quick, bold, malleable, a born survivor, but he’s also an autodidact, though not an autodidact in the sense that Borges was: Arlt’s apprenticeship proceeds in disorder and chaos, through the reading of terrible translations, in the gutter rather than the library. Arlt is a Russian, a character out of Dostoyevsky, whereas Borges is an Englishman, a character out of Chesterton or Shaw or Stevenson. Sometimes, despite himself, Borges even seems like a character out of Kipling. In the war between the literary factions of Boedo and Florida, Arlt is with Boedo, although my impression is that his thirst for battle was never excessive. His oeuvre consists of two story collections and three novels, though in fact he wrote four novels, and his uncollected stories, stories that appeared in newspapers and magazines and that Arlt could write while he talked about women with his fellow reporters, would fill at least two more books. He’s also the author of a volume of newspaper columns called <em class="calibre11">Aguafuertes porteños</em> [Etchings from Buenos Aires], in the best French impressionist tradition, and <em class="calibre11">Aguafuertes españoles</em> [Etchings from Spain], sketches of daily life in Spain in the 1930s, which are full of gypsies, the poor, and the benevolent. He tried to get rich through deals that had nothing to do with the Argentine literature of the day, though they did have something to do with science fiction, and they were always categorical failures. Then he died and, as he would have said, that was the end of everything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">But it wasn’t the end of everything, because like Jesus Christ, Arlt had his St. Paul. Arlt’s St. Paul, the founder of his church, is Ricardo Piglia. I often ask myself: What would have happened if Piglia, instead of falling in love with Arlt, had fallen in love with Gombrowicz? Why didn’t Piglia devote himself to spreading the Gombrowiczian good news, or specialize in Juan Emar, the Chilean writer who bears a marked resemblance to the monument to the unknown soldier? A mystery. In any case, it’s Piglia who raises up Arlt in his own coffin soaring over Buenos Aires, in a very Piglian or Arltian scene, though one that takes place only in Piglia’s imagination, not in reality. It wasn’t a crane that lowered Arlt’s coffin. The stairs were wide enough for the job. The body in the box wasn’t a heavyweight champion’s.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">By this I don’t mean to say that Arlt is a bad writer, because in fact he’s an excellent writer, nor do I mean to say that Piglia is a bad writer, because I think Piglia is one of the best Latin American novelists writing today. The problem is, I find it hard to stand the nonsense &mdash; thuggish nonsense, doomy nonsense &mdash; that Piglia knits around Arlt, who’s probably the only innocent person in this whole business. I can in no way condone bad translators of Russian, as Nabokov said to Edmund Wilson while mixing his third martini, and I can’t accept plagiarism as one of the arts. Seen as a closet or a basement, Arlt’s work is fine. Seen as the main room of the house, it’s a macabre joke. Seen as the kitchen, it promises food poisoning. Seen as the bathroom, it’ll end up giving us scabies. Seen as the library, it’s a guarantee of the destruction of literature.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Or in other words: the literature of doom has to exist, but if nothing else exists, it’s the end of literature.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Like solipsistic literature &mdash; so in vogue in Europe now that the young Henry James is again roaming about at will &mdash; a literature of the I, of extreme subjectivity, of course must and should exist. But if all writers were solipsists, literature would turn into the obligatory military service of the mini-me or into a river of autobiographies, memoirs, journals that would soon become a cesspit, and then, again, literature would cease to exist. Because who really cares about the sentimental meanderings of a professor? Who can say, without lying through his teeth, that the daily routine of a dreary professor in Madrid, no matter how distinguished, is more interesting than the nightmares and dreams and ambitions of the celebrated and ridiculous Carlos Argentino Daneri? No one with half a brain. Listen: I don’t have anything against autobiographies, so long as the writer has a penis that’s twelve inches long when erect. So long as the writer is a woman who was once a whore and is moderately wealthy in her old age. So long as the author of the tome in question has lived a remarkable life. It goes without saying that if I had to choose between the solipsists and the bad boys of the literature of doom I’d take the latter. But only as a lesser evil.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The third lineage in play in contemporary or post-Borgesian Argentine literature is the one that begins with Osvaldo Lamborghini. This is the secret current. It’s as secret as the life of Lamborghini, who died in Barcelona in 1985, if I’m not mistaken, and who left as literary executor his most beloved disciple, César Aira, which is like a rat naming a hungry cat as executor.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">If Arlt, who as a writer is the best of the three, is the basement of the house that is Argentine literature, and Soriano is a vase in the guest room, Lamborghini is a little box on a shelf in the basement. A little cardboard box, covered in dust. And if you open the box, what you find inside is hell. Forgive me for being so melodramatic. I always have the same problem with Lamborghini. There’s no way to describe his work without falling into hyperbole. The word <em class="calibre11">cruelty</em> fits it like a glove. <em class="calibre11">Harshness</em> does too, but especially <em class="calibre11">cruelty</em>. The unsuspecting reader may glimpse the sort of sadomasochistic game of writing workshops that charitable souls with pedagogical inclinations organize in insane asylums. Perhaps, but that doesn’t go far enough. Lamborghini is always two steps ahead of (or behind) his pursuers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">It’s strange to think about Lamborghini now. He died at forty-five, which means that I’m four years older than he was then. Sometimes I pick up one of his two books, edited by Aira &mdash; which is only a figure of speech, since they might just as well have been edited by the linotypist or by the doorman at his publishing house in Barcelona, Serbal &mdash; and I can hardly read it, not because I think it’s bad but because it scares me, especially all of <em class="calibre11">Tadeys</em>, an excruciating novel, which I read (two or three pages at a time, not a page more) only when I feel especially brave. Few books can be said to smell of blood, spilled guts, bodily fluids, unpardonable acts.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Today, when it’s so fashionable to talk about nihilists (although what’s usually meant by this is Islamic terrorists, who aren’t nihilists at all), it isn’t a bad idea to take a look at the work of a real nihilist. The problem with Lamborghini is that he ended up in the wrong profession. He should have gone to work as a hit man, or a prostitute, or a gravedigger, which are less complicated jobs than trying to destroy literature. Literature is an armor-plated machine. It doesn’t care about writers. Sometimes it doesn’t even notice they exist. Literature’s enemy is something else, something much bigger and more powerful, that in the end will conquer it. But that’s another story.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Lamborghini’s friends are fated to plagiarize him ad nauseam, something that might &mdash; if he could see them vomit &mdash; make Lamborghini himself happy. They’re also fated to write badly, horribly, except for Aira, who maintains a gray, uniform prose that, sometimes, when he’s faithful to Lamborghini, crystallizes into memorable works, like the story “Cecil Taylor” or the novella <em class="calibre11">How I Became a Nun</em>, but that in its neo-avantgarde and Rousselian (and utterly acritical) drift, is mostly just boring. Prose that devours itself without finding a way to move forward. Acriticism that translates into the acceptance &mdash; qualified, of course &mdash; of that tropical figure, the professional Latin American writer, who always has a word of praise for anyone who asks for it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Of these three lineages &mdash; the three strongest in Argentine literature, the three departure points of the literature of doom &mdash; I’m afraid that the one which will triumph is the one that most faithfully represents the sentimental rabble, in the words of Borges. The sentimental rabble is no longer the Right (largely because the Right busies itself with publicity and the joys of cocaine and the plotting of currency devaluations and starvation, and in literary matters is functionally illiterate or settles for reciting lines from <em class="calibre11">Martín Fierro</em>) but the Left, and what the Left demands of its intellectuals is soma, which is exactly what it receives from its masters. Soma, soma, soma Soriano, forgive me, yours is the kingdom.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Arlt and Piglia are another story. Let’s call theirs a love affair and leave them in peace. Both of them &mdash; Arlt without a doubt &mdash; are an important part of Argentine and Latin American literature, and their fate is to ride alone across the ghost-ridden pampa. But that’s no basis for a school.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Corollary. One must reread Borges.</div>
