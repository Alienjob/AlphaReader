    <div class="paragraph">This answer won him a brief respite. The three men exchanged inquiring glances, then finally the assistant manager shrugged his shoulders and said, with his father’s approval:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … you have until tomorrow at three. Bring all your tally books and your receipts … You can go now.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">The decision took Erdosain so completely by surprise that he remained standing there abjectly, staring at the three of them. Yes, all three of them. At Gualdi, who had humiliated him despite calling himself a socialist; at the assistant manager, who had scornfully stared at his ragged tie; at the director whose bristling boar’s head was now tilted in his direction, his cynical, obscene gaze screened by the grey slit of his narrowed eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Yet Erdosain did not budge … He wanted to say something to them, without knowing what, something that would make them see the crushing misfortune that made his life a misery; so he just stood there, forlorn, the black cube of the safe on a level with his eyes, feeling his back bending further and further with the passing minutes while he nervously twisted the brim of his black hat, and his own look became more and more furtive and sad. Finally, he blurted out:</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“So, can I leave?”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“Yes …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No, I mean can I draw my wages today and …”</div>
    <div class="paragraph">“No … hand your receipts over to Suarez and bring everything else here tomorrow at three, without fail.” “Yes … everything.” Turning on his heel, Erdosain left without another word.</div>
    <div class="paragraph">He walked down Chile to the Paseo Colon. He felt himself hemmed in by invisible pressures. The sun picked out the disgusting interiors as the street sloped downwards. Such a jumble of disparate thoughts raced through his mind, it would have taken him hours of hard work to unravel them. Later he recalled that not for one moment had it occurred to him to wonder who might have betrayed him.</div>
